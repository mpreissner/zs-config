"""Plugin manager API router.

Exposes the operations `cli/menus/plugin_menu.py` already offers — GitHub login,
channel switching, manifest browsing, install, branch override, uninstall — so
the web UI can manage plugins without the TUI.

Four things shape the design:

*Off unless switched on.*  The whole router is registered only when the
environment variable named by ``MANAGER_ENV`` is set (see `api/main.py`).  On a
deployment that has not set it these paths fall through to the SPA catch-all
exactly like any address that was never routed, so nothing about the manager —
not a 403, not an entry in /docs — is visible to anyone poking at the API.  The
variable is deliberately absent from the README, the compose file and the
sample env: it is a switch for whoever runs the deployment, found by reading
this file.

*Managing and using are different roles.*  Installing a plugin runs pip against
a URL and then imports the result into this process on the next start, so every
management endpoint is behind `require_plugin_admin`, including the read-only
ones.  The three paths an entitled user reaches a plugin through — `/entitled`,
`/{package}/ui` and `/{package}/actions/{key}` — are behind `require_plugin_user`,
which admins fail: an admin installs and grants plugins, they do not run them.
An account that does both holds both roles and switches between them.  Every
refusal here is a 404, so neither role learns from the shape of one what the
other would have found.

*Installing is not publishing.*  A plugin becomes usable by an account only
once an admin grants it, per user or per SCIM group — zs-config may be shared,
and the team that asked for a plugin is rarely everyone with a login.  The
grant list lives in `services/plugin_entitlement_service.py`.

*A plugin's web interface is declarative.*  A plugin describes its actions and
their parameters; it ships no markup and no JavaScript, and its `run` callables
never leave the server.  `lib/plugin_web.py` holds that contract.  Every tenant
parameter is checked against the caller's own entitlements before an action
starts, so a plugin cannot widen the reach of the account running it.  A select
whose options the plugin computes is re-resolved when the action runs and the
submitted value checked against the result, because the dropdown that offered
it is on the far side of the request and proves nothing.

*An action may ask a follow-up question.*  A result carrying a `prompt` is a
stage that stopped on a decision, and the fields it wants were composed while it
ran — so the description is kept here, keyed by job and by account, and the
answer is checked against that copy rather than against anything the browser
sends back.  The action the answer runs is the one the prompt named, never one
the caller chose.

*An action may produce a file.*  Anything an action returns under `file` is
moved into a per-run spool directory and served from `/downloads/{job_id}` to
the account that started the job, until it ages out on the same clock the job
store uses.  The path never reaches the browser and the job id alone is not
authority to read it.

*A GitHub auth failure is never a 401.*  The web client logs the user out when
an authenticated call comes back 401 (`web/src/api/client.ts`), and "your
GitHub token expired" has nothing to do with the zs-config session.  Those are
409, and an upstream GitHub failure is 502.

*pip mutations are serialised.*  Install, uninstall and the branch switch all
share one job key, so two pip processes can never run against the same
environment at once.

Entry points are read when the interpreter starts, so a plugin that was just
installed or removed is not live until the process restarts.  Every job that
touches pip says so in its result rather than pretending the change took
effect.
