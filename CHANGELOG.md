## [3.6.1] - 2026-09-15

A maintenance release: import fixes, update checks, and the container's `zs-config` command.

Thanks to [@dustinmharris](https://github.com/dustinmharris) for reporting #139, #140 and #141, and for fixing #141 in #142.

### Deprecated

- **The `zs-config` package on PyPI is deprecated.** zs-config ships as a container deployment only; the PyPI package is no longer published and stops at 3.3.3. Do not install it — it predates every release since. Use `deploy.sh` (see the README), or install from a source checkout to run the TUI standalone.

### Fixed

- **ZPA import kept only the first page of each resource type** — lists were read one page of 20 at a time and the rest dropped, so larger tenants were silently truncated and SCIM groups churned between imports. Every page is now read, 500 objects at a time. (#141)
- **A failed fetch marked a resource type deleted** — when an import could not read a resource type (a timeout, a 5xx), every cached row of that type was flagged deleted, because none of them had been seen that run. A type whose fetch fails is now left as it was. Applies to ZIA, ZPA and ZCC imports.
- **Update checks never fired** — the daily update email and the TUI startup check read PyPI, which stopped at 3.3.3. Both now read the latest GitHub release. The TUI no longer offers an in-place pip upgrade; like the email, it shows the changelog and the redeploy command. (#140)
- **`zs-config` failed inside the container** with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cli'`. The image installed the command but not the packages behind it; they now resolve from `/app`, so `docker exec -it zs-config zs-config` launches the TUI. (#139)

## [3.6.0] - 2026-09-08

Scheduled cross-tenant sync moved a rule's shape but not always its scope. This release fixes every path by which a rule could arrive on the target pointing at the wrong objects, or at nothing, and teaches the sync to carry the objects a rule depends on.

### Added

- **A rule brings its dependencies with it** — selecting a rule for scheduled sync without also selecting every resource type it references landed the rule on the target with those references dropped: widened to *Any* where the field is a scope filter, or disabled where a scope check requires it. Whether a rule arrived intact depended on which unrelated boxes the operator happened to tick, and in label mode there was often no box to tick — a network service carries no labels. The sync now walks the selected rules' references and pulls in the objects they require, whatever their resource type, along with anything those objects require in turn. Only leaf configuration objects are created this way: identity and environment objects (locations, groups, departments, users, device groups, proxy gateways) carry tenant-specific state a dependency walk has no business inventing on another tenant, and predefined catalogs exist identically everywhere. Those still resolve by name, exactly as before.
- **The run history says what was pulled in and why** — each dependency is reported with the rule that required it, and the same attribution is written to the audit log per object. These are informational: a run that carried dependencies is the feature working, so it no longer reports `partial` on that account alone.
- **Cloud app instances replicate across tenants** — a cloud app control rule can be scoped to a named instance of a SaaS app (the corporate Google Drive tenant, say, as opposed to a personal one), and that scope was the one part of the rule that could not travel. Instances were imported for reference only: no client methods, no push handler, and an entry in the sync exclusion list. A rule that named one arrived on the target with the field stripped, which the API reads as *Any* — the widest possible reading of a rule written to be narrow. Instances now push and sync like any other resource, ahead of the rules that reference them, and a rule's `cloud_app_instances` refs resolve to the target's own IDs. The strategy is replicate-falling-back-to-resolve: an instance absent from the target is created, and one already there under the same name is reused and updated in place rather than duplicated. The resource keys on `instance_id` rather than `id`, which is why it needs a handler of its own — the generic create path reads `id` off the response, would have found nothing, and would have dropped the mapping without saying so.
- **A rule that still cannot resolve its instance scope is disabled, not widened** — when every instance a rule names is missing from the target and cannot be created, the rule is created DISABLED with a warning naming the instances, rather than created enabled against everything. On an update the target's own state is left as the operator set it, with the same warning. This is the treatment locations, groups, departments and ZPA app segments already get.

### Fixed
- A synced rule's locations, groups, departments and users are now resolved against
  the target's current state. A sync run imports the resource types it was given and
  the types the dependency walk replicates, but never the resolve-only types — so
  the scope of a rule was matched by name against whatever an earlier import had
  left in the database. Where that row had since been deleted on the target, the
  rule was pushed with a dead ID and rejected; where the target had reassigned the
  ID to something else, the rule was accepted and silently scoped to the wrong
  object. The target's rows for these types are now refreshed before the diff runs,
  and only for the types a selected rule actually references.
- Custom URL categories are now translated between tenants. `urlCategories` arrives
  as a flat list of strings (`["CUSTOM_05"]`), and the sync engine treated every
  such string as a Zscaler-defined constant and shipped it unchanged — but
  `CUSTOM_NN` is a tenant-local slot assigned in creation order, so a rule scoped to
  "Customer Blocklist" on one tenant could land pointing at an unrelated category,
  or at none. Custom categories referenced by a synced rule are also created on the
  target now, and categories whose name the API returns only in `configured_name`
  are no longer invisible to the sync.

- **`No write method for cloud_app_control_rule`** — pushing or syncing a cloud app control rule failed outright with that error. The rule's endpoints take the rule type (WEBMAIL, STREAMING_MEDIA, AI_ML and the rest) as a leading path segment, so the call takes an argument the shared write table has no way to express; the type was in the table with no method behind it. It now routes through a handler of its own, as its delete path already did.
- **Most cross-tenant references shipped the source tenant's IDs** — the sync engine remapped labels, locations and location groups by name, and passed every other reference array through untouched. ZIA IDs are small dense integers, so a source ID almost always exists on the target as an unrelated object: a rule scoped to network service `SMTP-Custom` (id 5) arrived scoped to whatever id 5 is on the target. The API accepts it, the rule looks configured, and it filters the wrong traffic. Worse, it never settles — the target's name differs from the source's every run, so the rule is rewritten on every sync forever. **If a sync task's history shows the same rules updating on every run and never reaching a clean state, this is why.** Every reference array is now resolved by name against the target.
- **Five reference fields were not in the tables at all** — `override_users`, `override_groups`, `dlp_engines`, `bandwidth_classes` and `tenancy_profile_ids` were neither remapped nor recognized, so they shipped source-tenant IDs even after the fix above.
- **A network service group's members pointed at the wrong services** — the member list lives under `services`, which was in neither reference table, so a replicated group landed on the target referencing whatever services held those IDs there.
- **URL category scope was silently widened to *Any*** — `url_categories` and `url_categories2` hold either Zscaler-defined string constants or embedded tenant-local objects. The slim pass looked for objects, found none in the string form, and dropped the field, which the UI reads as *Any*. Each element is now classified individually: constants pass through, tenant-local categories are resolved against the target.
- **Device scope was dropped from three rule types** — the push path looked up `devices` and `device_groups` under their plural names while the importer stores them singular, so the lookup returned nothing, every device reference was stripped, and the stripped-scope check disabled the rule. Affected SSL inspection, forwarding and URL filtering rules.
- **Scheduled sync applied resources in alphabetical order** — phase 1 sorted on the resource type string, which puts dependents ahead of what they depend on: `cloud_app_control_rule` before `cloud_app_instance`, `firewall_rule` before `ip_source_group`. The reference was unresolvable at apply time and got stripped, self-healing only on some later run once the dependency happened to exist. The sort now keys on the push dependency tier. Deletes had the mirror problem — mixed into phase 1 they inherited the create ordering, so an object could be deleted while a rule still referenced it; they are now their own batch, in reverse tier order, applied after the content phase and before the reorder phase — a reorder writes an absolute position, so a delete applied afterwards shifts every rule below it up a slot.
- **The stripped-scope check never reached cloud app control rules** — it lives after the point where that rule type returns through its own handler, so a cloud app control rule whose locations all failed to resolve was created enabled and tenant-wide. It now runs for that type too.

### Notes for operators

- A sync job may now touch resource types you did not select. A labeled rule that references a network service, an IP group or a cloud app instance brings that object with it, because the alternative is the rule arriving mis-scoped. The run history names every object pulled in and the rule that required it.
- Dependencies are never deleted. A pulled-in type is exempt from the delete pass even when *sync deletes* is on — the job holds only the identities the selected rules referenced, and reaping everything else in that type would take target-local objects with it.
- A sync that reports `partial` with a `WARNING:` line naming an object means a rule landed with its scope widened or dropped. Expect this for the resolve-only types — locations, groups, departments, users, device groups — which must exist on the target under the same name before the next run resolves them.
- A DLP engine pulled in as a dependency is reported with a warning. Its expression can name dictionary IDs that the walk cannot follow, so the engine is replicated but its expression is not verified against the target.

## [3.5.2] - 2026-08-19

A bug fix release. Privilege separation between the admin and user roles, in the two places it was never applied.

### Fixed

- **An admin session could enter the tenant workspace** — an account holding both roles could, while acting as admin, click a tenant tile and land in tenant configuration. Entitlement cannot separate the two: `check_tenant_access` is role-agnostic by design, and an account holding both roles is entitled to the tenant either way, so only the assumed role can. The five product routers now carry a `require_user` guard on the include rather than per endpoint, so a route added to any of them is covered without anyone remembering to ask; entitlement is still checked as it was. An admin's tenant tile stops being a link and drops the hover-lift that advertised it, and a bookmark or deep link into a workspace returns to the dashboard instead of rendering a page of 403s. Import stays available to an admin — pre-loading a new tenant environment before its first user arrives is a management function, not tenant configuration. The stale `require_admin` guards on the ZCC and ZIdentity routers, left from before roles were assumable, become `require_auth` plus entitlement; they would otherwise have been unreachable.
- **An admin could see, apply, and share every user's templates** — the template list came back unfiltered for an admin, and `can_apply` was an alias for `can_read`. An admin now sees exactly the templates with no owner, and has two moves on them: hand one to an account that holds the user role, or delete it. Applying is refused at every ownership state, as are create, share, and preview, and PATCH accepts nothing from an admin but `owner_user_id`. Assigning to an admin-only account is refused — it would only rename the stranded state.
- **A deprovisioned account's templates were left owned by it** — nobody could apply them and nobody could delete them. Deleting or deactivating an account now clears the owner on its templates and audits what moved, in every path: admin delete, admin deactivate, and SCIM PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Done explicitly rather than through the column's `ON DELETE SET NULL`, since SCIM only soft-deletes and both kinds of deprovisioning have to leave the same state behind. The owner's name survives as attribution, so the admin picking these up can still see whose they were. The Templates item appears for an admin only while that queue is non-empty, and carries its count.

---

## [3.5.1] - 2026-08-19

A scoped template can name individual settings toggles instead of carrying a whole settings object.

### Added

- **Per-key selection for settings singletons** — ZIA keeps advanced settings, URL & cloud app settings, and browser control settings as one object each, holding dozens of unrelated toggles, and a template carrying one of those carried all of it. Taking a tenant's AI prompt controls meant taking its session timeouts along with them. A scoped template can now name the keys it wants: the picker opens a settings entry into its own filterable key list, and the template stores only what was ticked. Naming no keys still carries the whole object.

### Changed

- **A settings push merges rather than replaces** — the three settings endpoints replace the whole object on PUT, so a payload carrying a subset of the keys would reset everything it omits. The GET-then-merge that existed only for browser control settings, to keep the target's own Smart Isolation profile, now covers all three: the target's live settings are read first and the template's keys are laid over them. Classification compares only the keys a partial baseline carries, so a narrowed template does not report an update it does not intend to make. A full template carries every key, and merging one of those is the same PUT it always was.

---

## [3.5.0] - 2026-08-19

Policy Templates gain ownership, sharing, and scoped resource selection, and the proxy-chaining resources — root certificates, proxies, proxy gateways — are imported and pushed.

### Added

- **Template ownership and sharing** — a template now belongs to the account that created it and is visible only to that account until it is shared. Sharing is per template, to users or groups, managed from the template itself; `template_share_service` is the single place visibility is resolved, so the list endpoint and every by-id lookup answer the same question the same way.
- **Scoped resource selection** — a template no longer has to carry a whole snapshot. The wizard offers the resources the snapshot contains and stores only what is selected, which is now the default path through it. A scoped template records its scope, and wipe mode is refused for one: wipe deletes everything the baseline does not name, and a template that names four resources on purpose would empty the tenant. The refusal is enforced in the API, not only hidden in the UI.
- **Proxy chaining resources** — proxies, proxy gateways, and root certificates are imported, the certificates with their PEM. Certificates and proxies are pushed; `rootCertificates` needs a `certTypes` parameter and the raw PEM unencoded, which the client now sends.

### Changed

- **A scoped apply imports only what it needs** — applying a scoped template read all 53 resource types twice, once before classification and once after the push, to pick up changes in a handful. Both are narrowed. The closing re-import takes the template's own types; the stale-marking pass takes the same filter, so types that were not re-read are not swept as deleted. The pre-push import cannot narrow that far — reference resolution drops any ID it cannot find in the local database, so a rule scoped to a location or group that was not imported would be pushed with that scoping silently stripped — so the types classification consults regardless of what a baseline contains are collected in `REFERENCE_TYPES` and unioned into whatever set the caller asks for. Measured against a live tenant with a six-type template: classification 66.9s → 23.2s, re-import 64.0s → 11.5s, with identical classification output. Full templates keep the full import at both ends.
- **Proxy-chaining rules report what cannot be pushed** — `proxy_gateway` has no write endpoint (a POST answers `405 Allow: GET,OPTIONS`), so it and the PROXYCHAIN forwarding rule that sits above it are reported as manual build steps rather than pushed or silently dropped. Gateways already present in the target are matched by name so a report can name the target's own.

### Fixed

- **Cursor resets under concurrent database access** — a long-running job and an HTTP request could not use the database at the same time. `StaticPool` shares one SQLCipher connection across the whole process, and SQLCipher resets every open cursor on commit, so a background apply thread committing mid-query broke the request with `Cursor needed to be reset because of commit/rollback and can no longer be fetched from`. Each caller now gets its own connection from a `QueuePool`.
- **A delta push reported no manual steps** — classification builds the manual-build reports for entries the API refuses to create, and the wipe path merged them into its result while the delta path — which every scoped apply takes — kept only the push records and threw the reports away. An apply that pushed a certificate and proxy but could not create the gateway or the rule above it reported success and said nothing about the half of the chain still to build by hand.
- **The apply modal looked stuck on the last resource pushed** — the status line chose which phase to display by priority rather than by recency, so once a push event arrived it stayed pinned there, and the re-import that follows the push displayed as the last rule pushed for as long as it ran.
- **A certificate's own PEM read as a reference** — the PEM body was matched by the reference-stripping pass and mangled on push.

---

## [3.4.1] - 2026-08-03

A maintenance release. Mostly internal plumbing, a TUI-only function surfaced to the web interface, and fixes to the identity handling that shipped in 3.4.0.

### Added

- **ZIA snapshot restore in the web interface** — parity work rather than a new capability: restore existed only in the TUI, `ZIAPushService` already had every piece it needs, and with the TUI deprecating in v4.0.0 that path was about to become unreachable. The web flow mirrors the terminal one — classify, push creates and updates, verify and optionally remediate, delete resources absent from the snapshot, activate, verify the deletes, audit — and streams progress over the existing job store. `delete_extras` defaults to true, since a restore that leaves resources created after the snapshot in place is not a restore; the preview endpoint exists so the UI can show that set before the user commits. Distinct from Apply Snapshot, which pushes one tenant's snapshot onto another and never deletes.

### Changed

- **ZPA push engine extracted into a service** — the only ZPA write engine lived as ~330 lines of nested closures inside the restore handler, so nothing outside that HTTP handler could reach it: no dry run, no rollback, no way to test it without a request. It is now `services/zpa_push_service.py`, mirroring `ZIAPushService`'s classify/execute contract. Ordering, payload cleaning, ID remapping, and capability sets move verbatim. The extraction adds a merge mode that matches by name and has no delete path reachable from it, and classification without writes behind the restore preview; the duplicate capability sets in the snapshot diff endpoint fold into the service constants so the preview cannot drift from the executor.
- **Staged resource rows are implemented** — `zpa_resources` and `zia_resources` have long carried `source` and `candidate_status` columns with nothing behind them. `services/candidate_service.py` fills that in, product-neutral across ZPA and ZIA, so proposed configuration can sit in the local database and be reviewed before anything reaches a tenant, and `services/candidate_baseline.py` hands the reviewed set to the push engines — reporting what an engine cannot write rather than dropping it silently. Internal plumbing; no product surface of its own.
- **Staged rows are excluded from tenant state** — `get_snapshot_data_current()` now filters on `source='tenant'`. It feeds snapshot creation, the ZPA push baseline, and the diff endpoint, so without this a staged row would be captured as tenant config and the push engine would believe it already existed. Both import services' stale-marking passes exclude staged rows for the same reason: they are never returned by the tenant API, so every import would otherwise have flagged them deleted.
- **Extension points gained a declarative contract** — an extension describes what it offers and zs-config renders and runs it, so extensions carry no markup and no JavaScript. Administered from Admin; access is granted per extension to users or groups.
- **Secret-looking values are redacted from push error text** before it reaches an audit row or a job payload.

### Fixed

- **SCIM groups were provisioned but never handled** — 3.4.0 added group provisioning to the SCIM server without the local half: a group existed only as a role mapping, so there was nothing to manage it with, no way to create one that did not come from the IdP, and no way to see membership. `scim_groups` becomes `user_groups` with a source marker, and a SCIM sync replaces only its own rows, so a hand-added member survives it. Groups grant tenants as well as roles, with `group_service.effective_tenant_ids()` as the single place the union of direct and group grants is computed, so the two enforcement points cannot disagree. The admin Groups page is where membership, role mapping, and tenant grants are managed; the SCIM settings section keeps a read-only view of what the IdP has provisioned.
- **A group's role mapping overwrote the account's own role** — a locally created admin who joined a user-mapped group was silently demoted, and there was no way to hold both roles, since one column had to win. A mapped role now adds to the set of roles the account may assume instead of replacing what it has. Only one role is ever live: the JWT carries the active role in `role` and the whole set in `roles`, sessions start at least privilege, and switching reissues both tokens so the choice survives a refresh. A role revoked mid-session falls back down rather than being honoured from a stale claim.
- **Last-admin guard missed group-mapped admins** — the guard counted only `User.role == "admin"`, which predated group role mappings and was wrong in both directions: it refused changes that were safe, because it could not see the group admins that would remain, and it allowed changes that were not, since an account holding admin only through a group failed the early return and SCIM could deactivate the last administrator of an IdP-driven deployment. `role_service.active_admin_count()` now answers for everyone, and call sites check *after* flushing the change rather than predicting the outcome, so the count is measured against what the edit actually did. Widened to the paths that had no guard at all — clearing or demoting a group's mapped role, deleting an admin group, removing its last member, and the SCIM equivalents.
- **Scheduled import tasks failed to create on older databases** — databases created before import tasks existed declared `scheduled_tasks.target_tenant_id` NOT NULL, and an import task has no target tenant, so creating one raised an IntegrityError surfacing as HTTP 500. The v2 migration assumed relaxing the constraint was a no-op on SQLite, which has no `DROP NOT NULL`; the table is now rebuilt, guarded and outside the additive migration loop that swallows exceptions.
- **`SAWarning` on every mapper configuration** — `TaskRunHistory`'s self-referential parent and children relationships both wrote `parent_run_id` without being linked, so SQLAlchemy treated them as two independent relationships competing for one column. Linking them with `back_populates` makes them two sides of one relationship.

---

## [3.4.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- **SAML 2.0 and OIDC single sign-on** — the Identity Provider placeholder in Admin Settings is now a working SSO implementation. OIDC uses the authorization-code flow with PKCE (S256), the discovery document, and JWKS-based ID token validation. SAML 2.0 is provided by `python3-saml` and includes an SP metadata endpoint plus ACS and SLO routes; the library is imported lazily, so a missing install returns 501 rather than breaking startup. Sign-in completes through a one-time code (`/sso/complete` → `POST /auth/sso/exchange`) so JWTs never appear in the URL bar, browser history, or `Referer` headers. Users are auto-provisioned with a configurable default role and group claim. Provider secrets (OIDC client secret, SAML SP private key) are write-only: encrypted at rest, never returned by the API, blank means "leave unchanged", and `__CLEAR__` wipes.
- **OIDC discovery lookup** — a Discovery URL field with a Fetch button, backed by `POST /api/v1/auth/sso/discover`. It accepts either the issuer or the full `.well-known` URL, reports the endpoints it found, and fills in the issuer, preferring the one the document itself declares.
- **Inbound SCIM 2.0 provisioning** — a SCIM server mounted at `/scim/v2` (outside `/api/v1`, where provisioning clients expect it) covering Users and Groups: create, replace, patch, soft delete, filtering, and the `ServiceProviderConfig` / `ResourceTypes` / `Schemas` discovery endpoints. Access uses opaque bearer tokens generated and revoked from Admin Settings, stored sha256-hashed and compared in constant time; the plaintext is shown once. Group-to-role mapping is supported and members inherit a mapping change immediately. Re-provisioning a deprovisioned user reactivates the existing row so entitlements and audit history survive, and any change that would leave the install with no active admin is refused. SCIM-managed accounts are flagged in the admin user list and edit modal, since local edits are overwritten on the next sync.
- **Let's Encrypt certificate issuance** — the SSL/TLS section of Admin Settings gains a Let's Encrypt source, so an internally deployed instance can serve a publicly trusted certificate. This matters behind ZPA Browser Access, where the client validates the certificate and cannot reach an internal CRL distribution point. Only the dns-01 challenge is supported — http-01 and tls-alpn-01 require Let's Encrypt to connect inbound, which does not work for an instance that is not publicly exposed. Cloudflare is the DNS provider; the API token is stored encrypted and is never logged or returned. Issuance runs as a streaming job with a pre-flight token check that avoids spending a failed validation against the rate limit, and a daily job renews inside 30 days of expiry. Account keys are kept per ACME directory so staging and production registrations stay separate.
- **Native GovCloud support** — GovCloud tenants now take the identical code path as commercial ones, via `zscaler-sdk-python` 1.9.39. The SDK resolves the ZIdentity OAuth host, the OneAPI gateway, and the ZPA config host from a single `cloud` key, retiring roughly 460 lines of raw HTTP calls that reimplemented those paths across the ZIA, ZPA, and ZIdentity clients. Tenants carry a FedRAMP tier (`gov` = High, `govus` = Moderate); the TUI and the web Add/Edit Tenant forms replace the free-text OneAPI URL prompt with a tier picker and derive both URLs from it. ZPA is no longer hidden for GovCloud tenants.
- **Import job resume** — imports keep running after the modal is closed, and reopening it now reattaches to the in-flight job instead of starting from a blank state. Jobs gained an optional key, `started_at` / `finished_at`, a 1-hour TTL prune for finished jobs, and an atomic `create_unique()` so two simultaneous requests cannot both start work for the same key. `GET /api/v1/jobs/active/import` reports the active job, the ZIA/ZPA/ZCC import endpoints are idempotent (returning the running job with `already_running=true` rather than launching a duplicate), and the SSE stream replays from the first event so buffered progress is visible on reattach.
- **Bulk tenant entitlements** — `POST /api/v1/admin/entitlements/bulk` grants one user access to several tenants in a single transaction. The grant is atomic, and tenants the user already holds are skipped rather than rejected.
- **Response compression** — `GZipMiddleware` is enabled. The JS bundle and CSS are roughly 700 KB uncompressed and about 160 KB compressed: invisible on a LAN, material over a proxied WAN path.

### Changed

- **GovCloud is no longer behind a feature flag** — the `ZS_ENABLE_GOVCLOUD` environment variable and the `govcloud_enabled` field it fed are removed. The GovCloud checkbox and FedRAMP tier picker are always shown in the tenant create and edit modals.
- **ZCC is suppressed for GovCloud tenants** — the FedRAMP OneAPI gateways (`api.zscalergov.us` / `.net`) authenticate a token but have no upstream for the `/zcc` service: every path under `/zcc` answers 500 with a zero-length body, valid path or not, while `/zia` and `/zpa` behave normally. Rather than offer operations that can only fail, `ZCCClient` raises `ZCCUnavailableError` when built from a GovCloud auth (translated to HTTP 400 at every construction site); the ZCC workspace tab, its import button, and the ZCC import row are hidden, with bookmarked ZCC URLs redirecting to ZIA; the ZCC main-menu entry is hidden in the TUI for a GovCloud active tenant; and ZCC is dropped from the scheduled import product picker for a GovCloud source and rejected server-side on task create and update.
- **HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects are cached for 5 minutes** instead of indefinitely, so a wrong target stays correctable rather than being pinned in the browser cache.

### Fixed

- **Reverse proxy and ZPA Browser Access access** — reaching the app through a proxy lands the browser on port 443, which broke several assumptions that only held for direct access on 8443. HSTS was gated on `request.url.port == 8443`, so the header was never sent to exactly the users behind a proxy; it now keys off the scheme, honouring `X-Forwarded-Proto`. The SSL health poll and the post-removal probe fetched hardcoded `https://host:8443` and `http://host:8000` URLs, which are not published through a proxy, so every probe hung until TCP timeout; they now probe the origin the browser actually used. `webauthn_origin` was pinned to `https://{domain}:8443`, failing origin validation for any passkey enrolled through a proxy; it is now derived from the public origin and overridable with `ZS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`.
- **HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect port** — the redirect always sent clients to `https://<domain>:8443` regardless of how they reached the app. Behind a proxy publishing on 443 that points the browser at a port nothing listens on, so it hangs until timeout rather than failing fast. The port now follows the request and `ZS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` overrides the whole origin. The hostname stays pinned to the certificate-validated domain from the database — taking it from the `Host` header would make this an open redirect — and a missing `Host` header keeps the direct-access port, since its absence is not evidence of a proxy.
- **TLS listener with a Let's Encrypt certificate** — `entrypoint.sh` kept its own copy of the "is a certificate installed" test and recognised only the upload mode, so an issuance left the container serving plain HTTP on 8000 with nothing on 8443. Because the healthcheck probes 8000, which answers in either branch, the container reported healthy while the UI was unreachable. The startup script now reads the active mode set and the certificate paths from `ssl_service` rather than restating them, which also makes those paths honour `ZSCALER_DB_PATH`, and warns on stderr when a mode implies a certificate that is not on disk instead of silently falling back to HTTP.
- **Admin database import rejected every encrypted database** — validation matched the plaintext `SQLite format 3` magic, but SQLCipher encrypts the file header too, so every current export was rejected as "not a valid sqlite database". Validation is now a trial open: plaintext files are still accepted on their header, and anything else is decrypted with the supplied key material, verifying the file and the key together. The endpoint also moved the upload over the live database *before* validating it, so a bad upload left the instance with no working database and no way back; the upload is now staged and probed first, and the previous database, key, and WAL sidecars are restored if the swap or reinitialisation fails. Adds `dispose_engine()` so pooled connections are closed before the file is replaced, preventing a stale SQLCipher handle from checkpointing its WAL over the incoming database.
- **OIDC provider not persisted** — the Protocol dropdown fell back to "OIDC" for display only, so an admin who filled in the OIDC fields without touching the dropdown saved a config with `idp_provider` unset. Test connection then answered "Select a provider first" and, less visibly, SSO reported itself disabled so the login page never showed the SSO button. The save now persists the protocol the form is displaying whenever any SSO field changes.
- **SSO test passed against an unusable IdP key set** — an IdP with no signing key assigned answers discovery happily, advertises HS256, and publishes an empty JWKS, so the test passed and the failure surfaced at the callback instead. Worse, `python-jose` raises `JWKError` there, a sibling of `JWTError` rather than a subclass, so it escaped the ID token handler as a 500 with a traceback. The key set is now checked as part of the test, `JOSEError` is caught, and the empty document is explained in terms of the setting that causes it. The test re-reads the JWKS so an admin who has just assigned a key is not shown a cached failure.
- **Unreachable IdP reported as a hang** — an IdP that resolves in DNS but is blocked on the network made Test connection and Fetch sit for a full 10-second connect timeout and then return the raw `urllib3` exception. The timeout is split into (connect, read) = (5, 10) and transport failures are translated into plain English distinguishing a blocked route from bad DNS, a refused port, an untrusted certificate, and a non-JSON response.
- **SCIM bearer token Revoke button gave no feedback** — the button fired the mutation and displayed nothing on failure: no error, no pending state, and the row stayed put, so a rejected request was indistinguishable from a dead button. Adds the error surface, a per-row "Revoking…" state, and a confirmation, matching the security-key removal flow.
- **500 when granting several tenants at once** — the grant modal sent one `POST /entitlements` per tenant via `Promise.all`, so the requests arrived together and FastAPI ran each sync handler on its own threadpool thread. Those threads share a single database connection, so the requests landed inside each other's transactions: the first commit ended the transaction on the connection, and a sibling's `session.refresh()` then had nothing to refresh. Granting one at a time worked because it serialised them. The modal now makes a single bulk call.
- **Logout storm on an expired token** — an expired token 401s every in-flight query at once, and each one called back into logout, firing one logout POST per query (six on the dashboard). Logout is now latched. Separately, the API client skipped the logout callback for every path containing `/auth/`, so an expired token on the admin-only SSO helpers surfaced as a bare HTTP 401 next to the button while the app went on pretending to be signed in; that check is now narrower.
- **Settings form overflow** — long values (the redirect URI, ACS, and SCIM URLs) forced their row wider than the enclosing card, because the field content column could not shrink below its intrinsic width.
- **TUI template-apply and full-clone** — two pre-existing `ZIAClient(...)` call sites in `zia_menu.py` passed keyword arguments the class never accepted, raising `TypeError`.
- **`deploy.sh` on hosts without Docker socket permissions** — the script now falls back to `sudo docker` rather than failing.
- **`deploy.sh` image pulls over broken IPv6** — cloud VMs and corporate-proxy hosts often have a non-functional IPv6 route, and Docker's puller has no IPv4 fallback, so pulls time out resolving `registry-1.docker.io`. Known Docker Hub hosts are pinned to IPv4 in `/etc/hosts` for the duration of the build and the pin is removed on exit.

### Deprecated

- **The TUI will be formally deprecated in v4.0.0.** New features are now built for the web interface only, and the TUI is no longer kept at feature parity — several capabilities added in this release (SSO, SCIM provisioning, Let's Encrypt issuance) are web-only, as scheduled tasks and SSL configuration already were. Nothing is being removed in the 3.x line: the TUI continues to work, and the service layer it calls is the same code the web API uses, so no backend functionality is lost either way. If you rely on a TUI-only workflow, now is the time to say so.

### Known limitations

- The database engine uses a single shared connection, so concurrent writes from any source can still interleave transactions. The bulk entitlement endpoint removes the application's only deliberate parallel writes, but the underlying connection sharing is untouched.

---

## [3.3.3] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Scheduled import tasks** — new `task_type = "import"` scheduled task runs ZIA, ZPA, and/or ZCC imports against a single tenant on a cron schedule. Supports multi-product selection; no diff, push, or activation is performed. Useful for keeping the local DB cache current without any mutation risk.
- **One-to-many sync fan-out** — sync tasks now support `target_tenant_ids` (a list of target tenants) in addition to the existing single-target mode. Each target runs the full import→diff→push pipeline independently with its own ordering context. Run history records one row per target plus a parent rollup row with aggregated status and resource counts.
- **Scheduled tasks web UI** — the web interface now fully supports v2 scheduled tasks. A task-type toggle (Sync / Import) appears at the top of the create form. Import tasks expose a product checkbox group (ZIA / ZPA / ZCC). Sync tasks retain the existing single-target mode and add a fan-out toggle with a chip-based multi-tenant picker. The Monitoring tab shows a Target column and expands fan-out parent rows to reveal per-target child run status inline.
- **LP traffic split in the ZCC traffic profile visualizer** — when a Listening Proxy (LP) forwarding profile is detected, the SVG diagram renders a split-path layout: web traffic routes through the LP node to ZIA while non-web traffic bypasses LP and goes directly local. The LP node is highlighted in amber and the two outbound paths are labeled.
- **PAC bypass parsing in the ZCC traffic profile visualizer** — the traffic profile visualizer now fetches and parses the tenant's active PAC file. Detected `DIRECT` rules are categorized as RFC 1918 ranges, domains, or other and surfaced in the Local/Direct node detail panel. The parsing uses heuristic pattern matching on the PAC source and covers common variable-assignment and `if`-condition forms.
- **Traffic simulator in the ZCC traffic profile visualizer** — a destination + port input below the SVG diagram evaluates the active forwarding and bypass rules for a given address and returns an outcome (ZIA, ZPA Private, or Local/Direct) with a per-rule explanation list. Results update in real time as the network context (On/VPN/Off) is changed.

### Changed

- **ZCC traffic profile visualizer — detail tab strip** — Tunnel Routes, ZPA, and Port Bypasses tabs removed from the tab strip below the diagram. These detail panels are still reachable by clicking the corresponding node directly in the SVG diagram; the tab buttons were redundant given that the diagram itself drives panel selection.

### Fixed

- **PAC parser — RFC 1918 false positives** — the byte-range regex that identifies private address ranges now uses word boundaries (`\b`) to avoid matching numbers like `192` or `10` inside unrelated strings. The RFC 1918 normalization map was also hoisted out of the per-match loop.
- **ZCC traffic profile visualizer — Local node active state** — the Local/Direct node was incorrectly highlighted as active whenever PAC bypasses existed, even under Z-Tunnel 2.0 where all traffic is tunneled. The `localActive` flag now depends only on process bypasses and tunnel exclude routes, not PAC bypass count.
- **Scheduled tasks — edit form defaults** — `task_type` is now treated as optional on existing task records to maintain compatibility with pre-migration rows. The import product selection in edit mode correctly defaults to all three products when the stored value is absent rather than defaulting to an empty selection.

---

## [3.3.2] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **ZPA import** — ZPA import now completes successfully when using `zscaler-sdk-python` ≥ 1.9.25. Newer SDK versions return non-JSON-serializable `Version` objects for certain ZPA resource fields; the conversion layer now coerces these to their string equivalents before writing to the database.

---

## [3.3.1] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Deploy script (Linux/macOS and Windows Desktop)** — re-running `deploy.sh` or `deploy.ps1` on an existing installation no longer prompts for network binding or SSL configuration. Both prompts are skipped when an existing `JWT_SECRET` is detected in `.env`, since these settings are already established. SSL managed via the web UI (stored in the database) is unaffected.

---

## [3.3.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- **ZCC traffic profile visualizer** — interactive SVG pipeline diagram in the web UI showing how a ZCC app profile routes traffic across On/VPN/Off Trusted Network contexts. The diagram renders a three-stage layout (network context → forwarding profile → ZIA/ZPA/Local destination) with live forwarding-profile fork lines. Arrows and trunk lines to inactive destinations (ZPA disabled, no local/direct rules) are hidden entirely. An app-profile bypass line routes around inactive destinations and attaches to the Local node with an upward arrowhead.
- **ZCC ZPA app panel** — selecting the ZPA destination in the traffic profile visualizer populates a detail table with private application data pulled from the ZPA tenant. When more than 20 app segments exist the view collapses to a 2nd-level domain summary to avoid unbounded lists for large enterprise deployments.
- **ZCC configuration snapshot and restore** — capture named snapshots of the full ZCC configuration from the web UI or TUI. Snapshots support field-level diff against live state and selective restore with dry-run preview. Restores execute dependency-ordered creates, updates, and deletes across all ZCC resource types.
- **ZCC extended resource types** — admin roles, fail-open policies, web privacy settings, predefined and custom IP apps, and process apps are now imported, stored, and exposed through both the web API and the TUI.
- **ZCC app profile expansion** — the TUI app profile view now shows enriched inline details including forwarding profile, ZPA status, PAC configuration, bypass rules, tunnel routes, DNS routes, and target user/group/department assignments.
- **Update notifications** — Admin → Settings → Updates adds a daily PyPI version check with SMTP email alerts. When a new version is available, the alert email includes the current and latest versions and the one-line command to re-run the deployment script. Requires an email address and SMTP server. A "Send Test Email" button validates the configuration immediately. No new container dependencies — `smtplib` is Python stdlib.

### Fixed

- **ZCC traffic profile — tunnel routes table** — the Tunnel Routes tab now shows only `include`-direction entries. Exclude entries (ZIA split-tunnel bypass ranges) are no longer listed. The tab count and table filter both apply the same predicate.
- **ZCC traffic profile — destination node alignment** — ZIA, ZPA, and Local destination nodes are now vertically centered at the same Y positions as their corresponding network context nodes (On=50, VPN=108, Off=166), replacing the previous uneven spacing.

---

## [3.2.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **ZPA config snapshots** — capture named restore points of the current ZPA configuration from the web UI. Snapshots store a full copy of all resource types with field-level diff support.
- **ZPA snapshot diff** — compare any snapshot against the current live state. The diff view shows added, removed, and modified resources with per-field change detail and per-operation support flags.
- **ZPA full snapshot restore** — restore a snapshot via a background job that executes dependency-ordered deletes (Phase 1), creates (Phase 2), and updates (Phase 3) across all ZPA resource types. Cross-resource ID references (e.g. `segment_group_id` on applications) are remapped automatically when resources are recreated with new API-assigned IDs.
- **Post-restore DB sync** — after a restore completes, the affected resource types are re-imported from the API so the local SQLite cache reflects the new state immediately.
- **ZPA web UI parity** — user portals, certificates, applications, and access policy rules now support full CRUD from the browser. Toggle (enable/disable) and delete actions added to ZPA connector, segment group, server group, and PRA sections.
- **DB-first reads for ZPA list endpoints** — certificates and applications list endpoints now read from the local SQLite cache rather than hitting the API on every request.

### Fixed

- **Phantom ZPA import updates on back-to-back runs** — `app_connector` and `service_edge` resources were incorrectly detected as changed on every import. Root cause: Zscaler computes relative-time strings (e.g. `last_broker_connect_time_duration: "22h 40m 07s"`) at query time; these change every second regardless of configuration. These telemetry fields are now stripped before hash computation.
- **Snapshot diff false positives** — snake_case metadata fields (`modified_by`, `modified_time`, `creation_time`, `modified_at`, `created_at`) from the ZPA API were not excluded from field-level diff calculations, causing spurious change entries. Added to `IGNORED_FIELDS` alongside their camelCase equivalents.

---

## [3.1.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **SSL/TLS certificate support** — upload a certificate bundle (PEM paste with separate leaf, CA chain, and private key fields; PEM file; or PFX/PKCS#12) via Admin Settings to enable HTTPS on port 8443. The container restarts automatically to apply the new mode. TLS 1.2+ is enforced; TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are rejected.
- **HTTP → HTTPS redirect** — when SSL is enabled, port 8000 issues a cached `301` redirect to the HTTPS URL. A `Strict-Transport-Security` header on HTTPS responses tells browsers to bypass the redirect on all future visits.
- **WebAuthn origin auto-update** — enabling SSL automatically updates the stored WebAuthn RP ID and origin to match the HTTPS domain. A confirmation dialog warns that all existing passkey and security key registrations will be invalidated before proceeding.
- **Domain-validated redirect** — the HTTP redirect target uses the domain validated against the uploaded certificate at upload time, not the incoming `Host` header.
- **Disable SSL** — removing SSL restores HTTP mode, resets the WebAuthn origin, and deletes the stored certificate files.

---

## [3.0.2] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **Scheduled sync — `user_risk_score_levels` stripped from payloads** — empty `user_risk_score_levels` arrays are now removed before syncing, preventing API rejection errors.
- **Scheduled sync — location and location group references remapped by name** — `locations` and `location_groups` references are now resolved to the correct target-tenant IDs by matching resource names across tenants, rather than passing source-tenant IDs verbatim. References with no name match in the target are dropped cleanly.
- **Scheduled sync — reorder operations clamped to target rule count** — `order` values in reorder operations are now clamped to the target tenant's current rule count to prevent out-of-range API errors.

---

## [3.0.1] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- **Template apply — smart wipe now preserves unordered resources** — unordered resources (rule labels, DLP engines, DLP dictionaries, URL categories, network app groups, etc.) that already exist in the template are preserved and updated in-place rather than deleted and recreated. Ordered rule types (URL filtering, firewall, SSL inspection, etc.) continue to use full wipe-first to ensure clean rank ordering.
- **Template apply — auto-provisioned isolation rules no longer wiped** — Cloud Browser Isolation rules auto-provisioned by Zscaler (`Isolate of …`) are now correctly detected as Zscaler-managed and skipped during wipe. Previously the API rejected their deletion with a 400, causing a cascading failure on any rule label they referenced.
- **Template apply — false-positive cloud app warnings removed** — cloud app control rules were incorrectly flagged with "applications may include custom cloud apps not in target" for standard Zscaler apps (GTALK, FACEBOOK, MYSPACE, etc.). The detection logic used the SaaS Security policy list as a proxy for the full cloud app catalog, which was the wrong data source.
- **Template creation — DLP engines, network apps, and cloud app reference types included** — `dlp_engine`, `dlp_dictionary`, `network_app`, `network_app_group`, `cloud_app_policy`, `cloud_app_ssl_policy`, and `cloud_app_instance` are no longer stripped from templates. Including them ensures the smart wipe can preserve them and the push service has the reference data needed for ID remapping. Existing templates should be recreated to pick up these types.
- **Template apply — granular per-resource audit logging** — the audit log now records an individual `DELETE`, `CREATE`, or `UPDATE` entry for every resource affected by a template apply, in addition to the existing summary entry. Wipe (DELETE) entries are written before push (CREATE/UPDATE) entries so timestamp ordering in the audit log matches the actual execution sequence.

---

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-06

### Breaking Changes

- **`libsqlcipher` system dependency required for native TUI** — v3.0.0 encrypts the entire SQLite database file using SQLCipher. The `sqlcipher3` Python package compiles a C extension against `libsqlcipher`, which must be present on the system before installation or upgrade. Docker deployments are unaffected (bundled in the image). The TUI auto-updater handles the system install automatically when upgrading from within the TUI; for a fresh install see the [Installation](#installation) section in the README.

### Added

- **Full SQLite database encryption (SQLCipher)** — the entire database file is now encrypted with AES-256-CBC via SQLCipher. All tables, indexes, and metadata are encrypted at rest. Previous versions encrypted only the `client_secret_enc` column; v3.0.0 encrypts the full file. The SQLCipher key is derived from the same `secret.key` material used for column encryption, so no separate key management is required.
- **Automatic plaintext migration** — on first launch after upgrading, an existing plaintext SQLite database is converted to SQLCipher in-place using `ATTACH DATABASE + sqlcipher_export()` (the SQLCipher-recommended migration path). A `.plaintext.bak` file is retained alongside the database until manually deleted.
- **Key rotation re-encrypts the database file** — `PRAGMA rekey` is issued atomically with column re-encryption so the full-database encryption key rotates in the same operation. The two phases are committed in order (columns first, then rekey) so a failure in phase 2 leaves a clear recovery path.
- **TUI auto-upgrade libsqlcipher gate** — when upgrading from the TUI to v3.0.0+, the update checker detects whether `sqlcipher3` is importable. If not, it offers to install `libsqlcipher` via the system package manager (brew / apt-get / dnf / pacman / zypper) before running the pip/pipx upgrade. If the user declines, the upgrade is skipped.

### Fixed

- **APScheduler job store bypassed SQLCipher** — `SQLAlchemyJobStore` was initialized with a plain `url=` argument, causing it to create its own SQLAlchemy engine without the SQLCipher `creator` function. This caused "file is not a database" errors on startup when SQLCipher was active. Fixed by passing `engine=get_engine()` so the job store shares the existing SQLCipher-capable engine.

---

## [2.1.3] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **ZIA Policy Templates** — create reusable, portable ZIA policy baselines from any config snapshot. Templates strip tenant-specific resource types (locations, VPN credentials, static IPs, identity data, etc.) and individual entries that reference non-portable scopes, producing a clean baseline that can be applied to any target tenant via the standard Apply Snapshot flow. A preview step shows exactly which resource types and entries are included or stripped, and why.
- **Audit Log search** — client-side filter on the Audit Log page matches across all visible fields (product, operation, action, status, resource name/type, error message, and details). The pagination footer shows the matching entry count when a search is active.

### Fixed

- **Clone Config — VPN credentials incorrectly pushed without full clone** — `static_ip`, `vpn_credential`, `gre_tunnel`, and `sublocation` are now classified as Full Clone-only types. The standard clone path (without "Full Clone" checked) no longer attempts to push these types.
- **Clone Config — masked PSK causes push failure** — when a full clone is performed and the source PSK is masked (`*****`), the push service now generates a random 20-character alphanumeric placeholder PSK, creates the credential with that placeholder, and surfaces a post-push warning so the operator can update the PSK manually in the target tenant.
- **Clone Config — redundant target tenant import on apply** — the preview step already imports the target tenant; proceeding to apply was triggering a second import unnecessarily. The delta apply path now skips the redundant import, reducing apply time by one full ZIA import round-trip.
- **Template preview — silent system rule strips surfaced as warnings** — Zscaler default/catch-all rules (order < 0) that exist in every tenant were being counted as user-visible strip warnings when creating a template. These are now stripped silently; only user-created rules dropped for portability reasons appear in the preview warnings.
- **Template — URL categories incorrectly stripped** — built-in URL categories are required in the template so the push service can build source→target ID remaps for rule payloads. All URL categories (built-in and custom) are now retained in the template; built-ins are matched by name in the target and skipped if they already exist.
- **`deploy.sh` — local file modifications abort git update** — the deploy script now uses `git reset --hard origin/<branch>` instead of `git pull`, avoiding conflicts when locally modified files (e.g. `docker-compose.yml`, `deploy.sh` itself) are present on the host. A `docker-compose.yml` customization dialog was also added: when the local file differs from upstream, the operator is prompted to keep their local version or use the upstream one; the local copy is moved aside before the reset and restored afterward.

---

## [2.1.2] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- **Encryption algorithm selection** — tenant secrets can now be encrypted with Fernet (default, unchanged), AES-256-GCM, or ChaCha20-Poly1305. The active algorithm is stored in `app_settings` and applied transparently to all encrypt/decrypt operations.
- **Key rotation** — `POST /api/v1/admin/rotate-key` re-encrypts all tenant secrets with a freshly generated key in a single atomic operation: decrypts all rows with the current key, generates a new key, re-encrypts, flushes, writes the new key file (with `.bak` rollback on commit failure), then commits. Available from Admin → Settings → Database & Maintenance → Encryption and from the TUI Settings menu (Security: Rotate Encryption Key).
- **FIPS mode** — a FIPS mode toggle in Admin Settings restricts algorithm selection to Fernet and AES-256-GCM. ChaCha20-Poly1305 is disabled in the UI and rejected with HTTP 400 when FIPS mode is enabled.
- **Auto-rotation schedule** — configurable rotation interval (days). On server startup, `rotate_key_if_due()` compares `key_last_rotated_at` against the interval and rotates automatically if due. Startup continues normally if auto-rotation fails.
- **`lib/crypto.py`** — new algorithm-agnostic crypto abstraction (`generate_key`, `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `load_key`, `save_key`) used by both `config_service.py` and `encryption_service.py`.
- **`entrypoint.sh`** — new container entrypoint; branches on `ZS_TUI_ONLY=1` to launch the TUI directly (`python -m cli.z_config`) instead of `uvicorn`.
- **`ZS_TUI_ONLY` env var** — set to `1` to run the container in TUI-only mode. The FastAPI server will not start.

### Changed

- `services/config_service.py` — stripped internal Fernet key management; now delegates entirely to `lib/crypto`. `encrypt_secret()` / `decrypt_secret()` read the active algorithm from `app_settings` on each call.
- Admin Settings → Database & Maintenance is now a single collapsible card combining Import Database, Clear Data, and the new Encryption section.

---

## [2.1.1] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- **GovCloud SSL trust** — the container now injects the host CA certificate store at build time (`deploy.sh` / `deploy.ps1` export from macOS Keychain / Windows cert store into the image), resolving SSL errors against GovCloud endpoints when the host is behind SSL inspection.
- **GovCloud import 429 rate limiting** — GovCloud API calls now retry automatically on 429 responses (up to 3 attempts, honouring `Retry-After` with exponential backoff fallback). Previously, a rate-limit response would silently drop the affected resource type from the import.
- **Tenant credential re-validation on edit** — editing a tenant in the web UI now re-validates credentials and refreshes org metadata when any auth-affecting field is changed. Previously, stale or incorrect credentials could not be corrected through the edit flow.

### Changed

- `zscaler-sdk-python` minimum bumped to `>=1.9.25`, picking up an internal fix for camelCase key normalization that could cause certain ZIA response fields to deserialize as `None`.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

#### Admin — Clear Data (web UI)
- **Clear Data on Settings page** — the Admin → Settings page now includes a "Clear Data" section. Admins can wipe imported resources, config snapshots, sync logs, and audit entries for all tenants or a specific tenant, with a confirmation checkbox before execution. Calls `POST /api/v1/admin/clear-data`.

### Fixed

#### Apply Snapshot — cross-tenant push reliability
- **URL Filtering Rule 400 errors** — `update_url_filtering_rule` was sending a snake_case payload via direct HTTP, but the ZIA endpoint expects camelCase. Switched to the SDK `update_rule()` method for non-GovCloud tenants (consistent with all other rule update methods).
- **DLP Web Rule duplicate treated as permanent failure** — when a name lookup failed (e.g. due to a transient 429 mid-lookup), the failure was marked `permanent` and never retried. Removed the `permanent:` prefix so multi-pass retry can recover after the rate window clears.
- **429 rate-limit spinning** — transient failures were re-queued immediately with no delay, causing repeated 429 hits until the "stable, no progress" cutoff. The push service now detects 429/rate-limit errors and sleeps for `Retry-After + 0.5s` (default 2s) before re-queuing.
- **ISOLATE action without CBI profile → 400** — URL Filtering Rules with `action: ISOLATE` fail when no matching CBI isolation profile exists in the target tenant. The normalizer now downgrades the action to `CAUTION` and records a warning in the push log. The rule can be corrected once a matching CBI profile is created in the target.

#### Web UI — tenant and import UX
- **Tenant switch — tab state not reset** — switching tenants via the left-side nav preserved component state (preview results, job IDs, expanded panels) because React retained the same component instances. Fixed by adding `key={tenant.id}` to all tab renders, forcing unmount/remount on tenant change.
- **Apply Snapshot source dropdown included active tenant** — applying a snapshot to yourself is a restore, not a cross-tenant apply. The active tenant is now excluded from the source dropdown.
- **Import progress — "This may take several minutes" message disappeared** — the advisory message was shown only in the indeterminate state and disappeared once per-resource-type progress arrived. Both the message and the progress counter are now always visible while an import is running.

#### Admin role
- **Scheduled Tasks hidden from Admin** — the Scheduled Tasks nav item is now hidden for users with the Admin role; admins are directed to admin-specific pages.
- **Clear Data scope missing snapshots** — the TUI Clear Data function was not deleting `RestorePoint` records. Both the TUI and the new web endpoint now delete config snapshots in addition to ZIA/ZPA/ZCC resources, sync logs, and audit entries.

---

### Added

#### Scheduled Cross-Tenant Sync Tasks

Automated, cron-driven sync of ZIA configuration between tenants — no manual trigger required.

**Sync by Resource Type**
- Create named scheduled tasks that sync one or more resource groups (Firewall Rules, URL Filtering, SSL Inspection, DLP, Network Objects, etc.) from a source tenant to a target tenant on a configurable cron schedule (preset intervals: 1h, 4h, 12h, 24h; or any custom 5-field cron expression)
- Optional **Sync Deletes** — removes resources from the target that are absent from the source; warned as irreversible once the target is activated
- Per-task enable/disable toggle and manual "Run now" trigger
- Owner email field for accountability

**Sync by Label (new in 2.1.0)**
- Alternative sync mode that targets resources by ZIA rule label rather than by type
- Enter a label name (e.g. `prod`, `test`) and optionally restrict to a subset of the 12 label-supporting resource types: Firewall Rules, URL Filtering Rules, SSL Inspection Rules, Forwarding Rules, Bandwidth Control Rules, NAT Control Rules, DLP Web Rules, DNS Filter Rules, IPS Rules, Sandbox Rules, Traffic Capture Rules, Cloud App Control Rules
- Label matching is case-sensitive and operates on the `labels` field of each resource's raw API payload
- When all 12 label-supported types are selected, the engine queries all of them; selecting a subset scopes the sync to only those types

**Task Monitoring tab**
- Per-task run history: start time, duration, status (success / partial / failed), resource count, error count
- Drill into any run with errors to see a table of failed resources with resource type, name, operation, and error message

### Fixed

- **URL Categories tooltip** — the ⓘ info icon in the scheduled task form was non-functional (native `title` attribute obscured by parent `cursor-pointer` cursor). Replaced with a CSS hover tooltip that appears immediately on hover and is keyboard-accessible.

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

#### Web UI — Browser-Based Management Interface

A self-contained Docker container ships a React + Vite + Tailwind frontend backed by a FastAPI REST API. All existing TUI service logic is reused — the web layer is a new presentation layer over the same DB, services, and lib clients.

**Authentication & Session Management**
- Login with username/password; bcrypt-verified against a `WebUser` table in the local DB
- Role-based access: `admin` and `user` roles; non-admin users are scoped to specific tenants via entitlements
- Force password change on first login and on admin-initiated reset
- MFA enrollment via TOTP — users with no key enrolled are shown a full-screen enrollment modal; QR code + manual entry supported
- Idle timeout: configurable inactivity threshold (default 15 minutes) triggers a 2-minute countdown warning, then automatic logout; idle timer resets on mouse movement, clicks, keyboard input, and scroll events
- Proactive JWT refresh: access token (5 min) is silently renewed against an httpOnly refresh cookie (60 min absolute from login); if the cookie has expired, the user is logged out cleanly
- Container restart invalidation: a startup nonce is appended to the JWT signing secret on every container start; all tokens signed in prior runs are immediately rejected
- OIDC/SAML IdP integration (configurable via Admin → Settings)

**Tenant Workspace (ZIA)**

## [1.0.20] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

#### ZPA Access Policy — CSV Import/Sync local DB sync
- **Reorder-only runs now trigger DB sync** — `_sync_policy_rules` previously skipped the post-mutation `ZPAImportService` call when a sync resulted in only a rule reorder (no creates/updates/deletes), leaving the local DB with stale `rule_order` values. Fixed by including `result.reordered` in the sync trigger condition.
- **DB sync failures now surfaced** — both `_sync_policy_rules` and `_bulk_create_policy_rules` now check the `SyncLog.status` returned by `ZPAImportService.run()` and display an appropriate warning or error instead of unconditionally printing success. This makes silent failures (e.g. `policy_access` auto-disabled due to a prior 401) visible to the user.

---

## [1.0.19] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

#### ZIdentity — SDK 1.9.21 path migration
- **Updated direct HTTP base path** — `ZIdentityClient._direct_base` updated from `/zidentity/api/v1` to `/ziam/admin/api/v1` to match the ZIdentity service migration introduced in zscaler-sdk-python 1.9.21. The old path returns HTTP 401 on GovCloud and would break on commercial. Verified against both commercial and GovCloud tenants.
- **SDK floor bumped to `>=1.9.21`** — `pyproject.toml` dependency updated accordingly.

---

## [1.0.18] - 2026-04-14

### Added

#### ZIA Config Snapshots — Dedicated Restore Flow
- **Restore Snapshot redesigned** — replaced the stub that delegated to Apply Baseline with a dedicated same-tenant rollback pipeline. Key differences from Apply Baseline:
  - **Unified dry-run** — creates, updates, deletes, and skips shown together before any changes are made; single confirmation to proceed
  - **Correct execution order** — creates/updates run first, then deletes in `WIPE_ORDER` (rules before their referenced objects), eliminating dependency constraint failures
  - **Two verify passes** — pass 1 confirms creates/updates landed (with remediation offer); pass 2 confirms deleted resources are actually gone
  - **Pending-delete resources excluded from verify pass 1** — resources queued for deletion no longer appear as discrepancies after creates/updates, since they are expected to still be present at that stage
- **`classify_snapshot_deletes()`** — new `ZIAPushService` method identifying DB resources absent from the snapshot without running a redundant import
- **`verify_deleted()`** — new `ZIAPushService` method that re-imports targeted resource types and confirms deleted IDs are no longer present in the live tenant

### Known Issues (tracked for future work)

#### Cross-Cloud Baseline Push — Commercial to GovCloud
Pushing a commercial ZIA baseline JSON export to a GovCloud tenant produces errors and failures. Root causes are under investigation. Do not use Apply Baseline or Restore Snapshot for commercial → GovCloud cross-cloud pushes until this is resolved. See README Known Issues for details.

---

## [1.0.17] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

#### ZIA Baseline Push
- **Scope-stripped rules stay DISABLED through remediation** — rules inserted as DISABLED because required scope resources (locations, groups, users, ZPA app segments) do not exist in the target tenant were being re-enabled when remediation ran. The update path now enforces `state=DISABLED` whenever scope is still stripped, matching the create-time behaviour. The rule self-heals once the admin adds the missing resource.
- **Delete dependency ordering in wipe-first mode** — `execute_deletes` now sorts by `WIPE_ORDER` so dependent rules (e.g. `url_filtering_rule`) are deleted before the objects they reference (`url_category`, `ip_source_group`). Previously, custom URL categories could fail to delete because filtering rules referencing them had not been removed yet.

### Added

#### ZIA Config Snapshots
- **Restore Snapshot** — new option in the ZIA Config Snapshots menu that applies a saved snapshot directly against its original tenant without requiring an intermediate JSON export. Reuses the full dry-run → push → verify → remediate → activate flow via the existing Apply Baseline pipeline.

### Changed

#### Startup & Tenant Switching
- **Auth check at initial launch** — selecting a tenant on first launch now runs the same credential verification, org info fetch, and subscription-change check that was previously only triggered on tenant switch.
- **Org info always displayed on activation** — the ZIA cloud, tenant ID, ZPA customer ID/cloud, and subscription retrieval status are now shown whenever a tenant is activated (launch or switch), regardless of whether the data has changed since the last check.

---

## [1.0.16] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

#### ZPA
- **Remove stale SDK monkey-patch** — the `ServiceEdgeControllerAPI._zpa` workaround (applied when SDK 1.9.x first shipped this API) is confirmed fixed in zscaler-sdk-python 1.9.20 and has been removed.

#### ZDX
- **Migrate ZDX client to SDK** — the previous `ZDXClient` was targeting `/zdx/api/v1` which returns 404. All ZDX functionality was non-functional. Rewritten to use `sdk.zdx.*` via the OneAPI `ZscalerClient`, fixing device lookup, user lookup, app scores, and deep trace. Base URL confirmed as `/zdx/v1` against a live tenant.

### Changed

- **SDK known issues documented** — added `### SDK known issues` section to README covering all active direct-HTTP bypasses: ZIA Browser Isolation `profileSeq`, ZIA URL Categories lite, ZCC `download_disable_reasons`, ZCC entitlement updates, ZIdentity password/MFA endpoints, and ZDX model deserialization bugs.

---

## [1.0.15] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

#### ZIA Baseline Push
- **Smart Browser Isolation — SSL Inspection rule ordering** — when the source tenant has Smart Browser Isolation enabled ("Smart Isolation One Click Rule" at order N) but the target does not (due to the API limitation), the push now detects the unprovisioned rule and renumbers the remaining SSL Inspection rules to fill the gap. Rules maintain the same relative order as the source, starting at 1.
- **Tab completion for file/path prompts** — all file and directory path prompts across ZCC, ZIA, and setup now use `questionary.path()` instead of `questionary.text()`, enabling tab-to-complete in the terminal.

---

## [1.0.14] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

#### Security
- **Dependency updates** — bumped to secure versions: `requests>=2.33.0` (CVE-2026-25645), `zscaler-sdk-python>=1.9.20`, `cryptography>=46.0.6` (CVE-2026-34073).

---

## [1.0.13] - 2026-04-02

### Added

#### GovCloud Support
- **GovCloud tenant flag** — `TenantConfig` now has a `govcloud` boolean column. Existing tenants are unaffected (migrated to `govcloud=False`).
- **GovCloud ZIdentity URL** — `build_zidentity_url()` now accepts `govcloud=True`, producing `https://<vanity>.zidentitygov.us` instead of `.zslogin.net`.
- **GovCloud oneapi URL default** — `GOVCLOUD_ONEAPI_URL` constant (`https://api.zscalergov.net`) added to `lib/conf_writer.py`; MOD-tier confirmed. User can override at add time.
- **Add/Edit tenant prompts** — adding a GovCloud tenant prompts for confirmation, shows the correct `.zidentitygov.us` subdomain hint, and presents an editable oneapi URL. Editing an existing tenant includes a GovCloud toggle.
- **Tenant list GovCloud column** — the tenant table now shows a `"Gov"` badge for GovCloud tenants.
- **API response** — the `/api/v1/tenants` endpoint now includes `govcloud` in each tenant object.
- **ZPA GovCloud routing** — `ZPAClient` accepts `govcloud_cloud` (e.g. `ZPAGOV_US` for MOD tier) and passes it to the ZscalerClient SDK config. Value is sourced from `orgInformation.zpaTenantCloud` at tenant creation time.

#### ZIA GovCloud Import
- **Full ZIA import support for GovCloud tenants** — all 42 ZIA resource types now work against GovCloud endpoints. The `ZscalerClient` SDK is not GovCloud-aware (it builds the token URL as `{vanity}.zslogin.net`), so every SDK-backed ZIA method falls back to direct HTTP when `govcloud=True`, using the confirmed GovCloud API paths:
  - `nat_control_rule` → `/zia/api/v1/dnatRules`
  - `location_group` → `/zia/api/v1/locations/groups`
  - `cloud_app_control_rule` → `/zia/api/v1/webApplicationRules/{rule_type}`
  - `sandbox_rule` → `/zia/api/v1/sandboxRules`
  - `dlp_web_rule` → `/zia/api/v1/webDlpRules`
  - All other resource types follow standard OneAPI camelCase path conventions.
- **`zia_delete()` helper** — added to `ZIAClient` alongside the existing `zia_get/put/post` helpers; used by all GovCloud delete fallbacks.
- **Allowlist/denylist GovCloud write** — GovCloud fallbacks for `add_to_allowlist`, `remove_from_allowlist`, `add_to_denylist`, `remove_from_denylist` use GET-merge/filter-PUT against `/zia/api/v1/security` and `/zia/api/v1/security/advanced`.
- **`traffic_capture_rule`** — import correctly attempts `/zia/api/v1/trafficCaptureRules`; returns 403 on tenants without the entitlement (logged as a non-fatal error, import continues).

---

## [1.0.12] - 2026-03-27

### Added

#### ZPA — Access Policy
- **`posture_profiles` CSV column** — access policy CSV import/export now supports posture profile scoping. Values are resolved by name to the profile's `posture_udid` used in ZPA policy conditions.
- **`risk_factor_types` CSV column** — access policy CSV import/export now supports Zscaler risk score scoping. Accepted values: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL` (comma-separated).
- **`scim_attributes` CSV column** — access policy CSV import/export now supports SCIM individual attribute scoping (`AttributeName=Value` format). Was previously unsupported despite being a valid ZPA condition type (`object_type: SCIM`).
- **Policy Scoping Reference export** — new "Export Policy Scoping Reference" option under the Access Policy menu. Generates a markdown file listing all available values per scoping criteria category: Client Types, Platforms, Risk Factor Types, Identity Providers, SAML Attributes, SCIM User Attributes, SCIM Groups, Machine Groups, Trusted Networks, Posture Profiles, and Country Codes.

#### ZPA — Application Segments
- **Apps & Groups Reference export** — new "Export Apps & Groups Reference" option under the App Segments menu. Generates a markdown file listing all imported Application Segments and Segment Groups with their IDs.

#### ZPA — Identity & Directory
- **SAML Attributes view** — new entry in the ZPA main menu showing all imported SAML attributes with name, IdP, and SAML attribute name.
- **SCIM User Attributes view** — new entry in the ZPA main menu showing all imported SCIM user attributes with name, IdP (resolved via DB lookup), and data type.
- **SCIM Groups view** — new entry in the ZPA main menu showing all imported SCIM groups with name and IdP (resolved via DB lookup from `idp_id`).

#### ZPA — Import
- **`posture_profile` resource type** — posture profiles are now imported and stored; uses `posture_udid` as the stored resource ID to match ZPA policy condition format.
- **`scim_attribute` resource type** — SCIM user attributes are now imported across all configured IdPs.

### Fixed

#### ZPA — Access Policy
- **SCIM_GROUP decode** — SCIM_GROUP policy condition operands always return `name: null` from the ZPA API. Decode now uses a `scim_group_map` (built from the DB, keyed by group ID) to correctly render group names as `IdpName:GroupName` in the CSV.
- **SCIM_GROUP build** — `_build_conditions` was incorrectly passing `lhs=group_id` for SCIM_GROUP conditions. Corrected to `lhs=idp_id, rhs=group_id` as required by the ZPA API.

---

## [1.0.11] - 2026-03-26

### Added

#### ZIA — Internet Access
- **`browser_control_settings` import and push** — Smart Browser Isolation settings are now imported as a resource and can be pushed cross-tenant. Includes CBI profile remapping by name and resolution of scoped users/groups.
- **One-click rule provisioning during push** — when a one-click governed rule (CIPA Compliance Rule, O365/UCaaS/Smart Isolation One Click rules) is enabled in the source but absent from the target, the push service now re-imports the affected rule types after pushing settings singletons, resolves the newly provisioned rules, and updates them in a second pass. Rules that remain absent after the re-import are marked `skipped:one_click_not_provisioned` rather than failing.

### Fixed

#### ZIA / ZPA — All Products
- **Rule list display order** — rules with negative positions (default/catch-all rules) were sorted to the top of every list. All rule list views now display positive positions ascending first, then negative positions descending, matching the Zscaler admin console order.

#### ZIA — Internet Access
- **CIPA Compliance Rule detection** — rules with `ciparule: true` are now correctly identified as Zscaler-managed and treated as read-only in the push service; their state is managed via the `enableCIPACompliance` toggle in URL/cloud app settings.
- **One-click rule state equivalence** — `toggle=OFF / rule absent` is now treated as functionally equivalent to `toggle=OFF / rule disabled`; no spurious create attempts are made for rules the target tenant has never provisioned.

---

## [1.0.10] - 2026-03-24

### Changed

#### Core
- Internal improvements.

---

## [1.0.9] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

#### Core
- **Banner version** — version string in `cli/banner.py` was not bumped during the 1.0.8 release; corrected to stay in sync with `pyproject.toml`.

---

## [1.0.8] - 2026-03-23

### Added

#### ZCC — Zscaler Client Connector
- **Export Disable Reasons CSV** — new export option under the ZCC menu. Prompts for a required date range (`startDate`/`endDate`), optional OS type filter, and IANA timezone (applied to the "Disable Time" column). Downloads the report directly from the API and saves as CSV. Columns: User, UDID, Platform, Service, Disable Time, Disable Reason.

### Fixed

#### ZCC — Zscaler Client Connector
- **Disable Reasons endpoint** — the SDK's `download_disable_reasons` wrapper is broken: it validates the response for an unrelated CSV format and strips the date range parameters. The implementation now bypasses the SDK, using direct HTTP with the correct required parameters (`startDate`, `endDate`) and optional `Time-Zone` header.

---

## [1.0.7] - 2026-03-23

### Added

#### Core
- **Default working directory** — `~/Documents/zs-config` is created automatically on first launch. All file export and import prompts now default to this directory, so users no longer need to type a path for every operation.

#### Plugin Manager
- **Exit after plugin install or update** — installing or updating a plugin now exits zs-config immediately after success (same behaviour as the self-update flow), ensuring the updated plugin code is active on the next launch rather than requiring a manual restart.

---

## [1.0.6] - 2026-03-22

### Added

#### Plugin Manager
- **Plugin channel selection** — users can now switch between `stable` (default) and `dev` plugin channels from the Plugin Manager (Ctrl+]). The active channel is persisted in the local database. A disclaimer is shown when switching to the dev channel.
- **Dev channel manifest fetch** — when the dev channel is active, the plugin manifest is fetched from the `dev` branch of the plugin repository rather than `main`, enabling independent versioning and update detection for pre-release builds.
- **Immediate update check on channel switch** — switching channels triggers an update check inline so dev builds are offered immediately without requiring a restart.
- **App settings store** — new `app_settings` table added to the local database for persisting application-level preferences (key/value). Existing databases are updated automatically on first launch.

---

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-21

### Security

#### Core / Plugin Manager
- **Database file permissions** — SQLite database is now created with `chmod 600` (owner read/write only). Previously world-readable (644), exposing tenant metadata, client IDs, and audit logs to other local users. Existing installations are corrected automatically on first launch after upgrade.
- **Plugin install URL validation** — install URLs from the manifest are validated against a GitHub HTTPS/SSH allowlist before being passed to pip. Arbitrary domains and local filesystem paths are rejected.
- **GitHub token removed from process listing** — token is now passed to git via a short-lived `GIT_ASKPASS` temp script rather than embedded in the install URL, preventing exposure via `ps aux` during the install window.
- **Uninstall package name validation** — package names are validated against PEP 508 before being passed to pip, preventing argument injection via malicious manifest entries.

---

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-21

### Added

#### Plugin Manager
- **Plugin entries in main menu** — installed plugins now appear as selectable entries in the main menu, visually separated from the core product list. The menu is rebuilt on each loop iteration so plugins installed or removed via the plugin manager (Ctrl+]) are reflected immediately without a restart. Plugins that failed to load are excluded.

---

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-17

### Added

#### Plugin Manager
- **Startup plugin update check** — on launch, after the zs-config self-update check, installed plugins are compared against the manifest in the plugin repository. If updates are available they are shown in a table and the user is offered the option to update all of them in one step. The check is skipped entirely if no plugins are installed, no GitHub token is present, or the manifest cannot be reached. If the zs-config self-update check finds a pending update, the plugin check is deferred to the next launch.

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

#### Plugin Manager
- **Entry point group rename** — plugin group renamed from `zs-config.plugins` to `zs_config.plugins` to comply with the stricter `python-entrypoint-group` format validation enforced by setuptools on Python 3.14+. Plugins using the old group name will need to update their `pyproject.toml` accordingly.

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added

#### Core
- **SSL inspection support** — startup injects the OS native trust store via `truststore` so corporate SSL inspection certificates (pushed by MDM/GPO/Jamf) are automatically honoured across all HTTP clients without any user configuration. A custom CA bundle can also be placed at `~/.config/zs-config/ca-bundle.pem`; if present at startup it is set as `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`.

### Fixed

#### Plugin Manager
- **Repo access gate at login** — GitHub Device Flow authentication now verifies that the authenticated user has collaborator access to the plugin repository before saving the token. Users who complete GitHub auth but are not listed as collaborators receive a clear error message at login time rather than discovering the restriction when browsing plugins.
- **SSH install URL conversion** — plugin install URLs using `git+ssh://git@github.com/` are automatically rewritten to `git+https://x-access-token:{token}@github.com/` at install time, using the already-authenticated GitHub token. Eliminates SSH host-key verification failures and SSH key requirements on machines that have never connected to GitHub.

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

#### PAN Migration Plugin — Push Bridge
- **Programmatic baseline push from palo-tools** — `apply_baseline_menu` now accepts optional `baseline=` and `baseline_path=` kwargs so the palo-tools plugin can hand off a just-converted baseline directly, without requiring the user to navigate separately to ZIA → Apply Baseline from JSON.

### Fixed

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline from JSON
- **Within-baseline ID remap type coercion** — string-keyed source IDs (e.g. PAN object names) are now correctly coerced to integers when resolving to target-tenant IDs. Previously `_remap_value` and `_ref_resolved` preserved the string type, causing ZIA API rejections.

---

## [0.11.4] - 2026-03-16

### Added

#### Plugin Manager
- **GitHub OAuth authentication** — Device Flow OAuth (no password prompt; supports MFA) via a classic OAuth App. Token stored at `~/.config/zs-config/github_token` (chmod 600). Login/logout available from the plugin manager.
- **Plugin discovery and install** — fetches `manifest.json` from the private `mpreissner/zs-plugins` repo via GitHub API. Lists available plugins not yet installed, installs via `pip install git+...` from the manifest `install_url`.
- **Installed plugin listing** — shows currently installed plugins discovered via `zs-config.plugins` entry points.
- **Uninstall support** — uninstalls a selected plugin via `pip uninstall`.
- **Hidden `Ctrl+]` key binding** — opens the plugin manager from the main menu without exposing it as a visible menu item.
- **Cancel navigation fix** — resolved crash when selecting "← Cancel" in install/uninstall selects (questionary returning title string instead of `None` for `value=None` choices).

---

## [0.11.3] - 2026-03-16

### Added

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline from JSON
- **`device_group` cross-tenant ID remapping** — ZIA device groups (Windows, iOS, Android, etc.) now have their source IDs remapped to the corresponding target-tenant IDs at classify time using name-based lookup. Rules that reference device groups are pushed with the correct tenant-specific IDs rather than the source tenant's IDs.
- **`sandbox_rule` full support** — ZIA Behavioral Analysis (Sandbox) rules are now imported, classified, and pushed cross-tenant. The `Default BA Rule` is automatically detected and skipped (Zscaler-managed). Normalizer handles URL category remapping, time windows, location/group/department/user scope resolution, and empty-field stripping.
- **`firewall_ips_rule` ordering and normalizer** — Firewall IPS Control rules are now treated as an ordered (first-match) policy engine: creates use the insertion-point stacking mechanism, updates are processed ascending, and delta-mode updates preserve correct ordering. A full normalizer handles cross-tenant ID remapping for locations, location groups, groups, departments, users, source/dest IP groups, network services, device groups, threat categories, and ZPA app segments.
- **Post-push consistency check with auto-remediation** — after every push, the target tenant state is re-imported and re-classified against the baseline. Any remaining creates, updates, or deletes (e.g. ordering constraint failures, missed deletes) are shown in a discrepancy table. The user is offered an auto-remediation pass before being prompted to activate. The activate default reflects whether the check passed cleanly.

#### ZIA — Import Config
- **`location_lite` resource type** — predefined ZIA locations (Road Warrior, Mobile Users, etc.) are now imported from `/locations/lite` and stored in the DB. These are not exposed in the Locations menu and are never pushed cross-tenant; they exist solely so their IDs are available for reference resolution when applying a baseline to a target tenant.
- **`device_group` resource type** — ZIA device groups are now imported (41 resource types total) and stored for cross-tenant ID remapping. They are never pushed.
- **`sandbox_rule` resource type** — ZIA Behavioral Analysis rules are now imported via the SDK sandbox rules endpoint.

---

## [0.11.2] - 2026-03-16

### Added

#### ZIA — Import Config
- **`location_lite` resource type** — predefined ZIA locations (Road Warrior, Mobile Users, etc.) are now imported from `/locations/lite` and stored in the DB. These are not exposed in the Locations menu and are never pushed cross-tenant; they exist solely so their IDs are available for reference resolution when applying a baseline to a target tenant.

---

## [0.11.1] - 2026-03-14

### Changed

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline from JSON
- **Delta mode is now non-destructive** — creates and updates only; resources present in the tenant but absent from the baseline are shown in the dry-run summary as informational only, with a note to use wipe-first if removal is needed. The deferred delete confirmation step has been removed from delta mode entirely.
- **Failed deletes surface as warnings, not failures** — if a delete fails (e.g. a Zscaler-managed resource slips through classification), the result is recorded as a manual-action warning rather than a hard failure, so it appears in the Manual Action Required section instead of the Failures table.

---

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline from JSON
- **Wipe-first push mode** — new mode selection before each baseline apply: _Wipe-first_ deletes all resources absent from the baseline before pushing (target mirrors baseline exactly); _Delta-only_ retains the existing push-then-confirm-deletes flow
- **`advanced_settings` pushed cross-tenant** — ZIA advanced settings (`/zia/api/v1/advancedSettings`) are now imported and pushed as a singleton resource in tier 2.5 (after URL categories, before rules), syncing toggles such as `logInternalIp`, `enablePolicyForUnauthenticatedTraffic`, and `blockNonCompliantHttpRequestOnHttpPorts`
- **`tenancy_restriction_profile` pushed cross-tenant** — Microsoft 365 and Google tenancy restriction profiles are imported and pushed as a tier-0 resource; `cloud_app_control_rule` entries that reference tenant profiles are now fully remapped rather than stripped
- **Scope-stripped rules inserted as DISABLED** — when a newly created rule references tenant-specific resources (locations, location groups, groups, departments, users, devices, ZPA app segments) that don't exist in the target tenant, the rule is inserted in `DISABLED` state and a manual-action warning is written to the push log and shown in the menu
- **Manual-action warnings in push log** — scope-stripped rules and other items requiring follow-up are captured in a `=== Manual Action Required ===` section of the push log file

#### ZIA — Import Config
- `advanced_settings` and `tenancy_restriction_profile` added to `RESOURCE_DEFINITIONS` (37 resource types total)

### Fixed

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline from JSON
- **Rule ordering for incremental pushes** — creates are stacked at the insertion point (descending) first; updates then move to their exact baseline positions (ascending); eliminates ordering constraint failures when rules share adjacent positions
- **DLP engine ID filter** — predefined engines (IDs 60–64, `custom_dlp_engine: false`) were incorrectly excluded from `_usable_dlp_engine_ids`; rules referencing them (e.g. PCI engine) now push with all engines intact
- **`cloud_app_control_rule` — predefined One-Click rules** — rules with `predefined: true` are provisioned by `url_filter_cloud_app_settings` and are now skipped during classification rather than failing with 404 (multiple rules share the same name across type buckets, making name-only lookup ambiguous)
- **`cloud_app_control_rule` — empty `applications` field** — rules with `applications: []` ("Any" in the UI) now omit the field entirely; sending `[]` or `["ANY"]` was rejected by the API
- **`_do_create_with_rank_fallback`** — "rank required" errors no longer trigger the rank-strip retry; only explicit "rank not allowed" errors retry without rank

### Changed
- `update_checker`: `CHANGELOG_TIMEOUT` (10 s) separated from version-check timeout (4 s); shows a message when changelog fetch times out

---

## [0.10.9] - 2026-03-13

### Added

#### Settings — Edit Tenant Metadata
- New **Edit Tenant Metadata** option in Settings menu — allows manual override of org metadata fields that are normally auto-fetched from `orgInformation`
- Editable fields: ZPA Customer ID, ZPA Tenant Cloud, ZIA Tenant ID, ZIA Cloud
- Pre-filled with current stored values; blank entry clears the field
- Introduced to handle cases where `orgInformation.zpaTenantId` returns `0` for valid tenants (confirmed Zscaler API behaviour on certain new tenants)
- `set_tenant_metadata()` added to `services/config_service.py` — unconditionally writes all four fields, unlike `update_tenant()` which skips `None` args

### Fixed

- `orgInformation.zpaTenantId` integer `0` was being stored as the string `"0"` rather than `None`; `str(0)` is truthy so the `or None` guard was bypassed — now evaluates the raw value before stringifying, in both `_fetch_and_apply_org_info` and `backfill_org_info_for_tenant`

---

## [0.10.8] - 2026-03-12

### Changed

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline from JSON
- `location` added to `SKIP_TYPES` — locations are tenant-specific (IPs must be provisioned by Zscaler per-org) and cannot be safely pushed as part of a cross-tenant golden baseline; they are now silently skipped during classification rather than attempted and failed

---

## [0.10.7] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- Bump version string in `cli/banner.py` and `pyproject.toml` to 0.10.7 (0.10.6 was published to PyPI without these updated)

---

## [0.10.6] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline from JSON

- **`rank` now included in POST/PUT payloads** — `rank` was incorrectly listed in `READONLY_FIELDS` under a "server-assigned" assumption. ZIA requires it in all rule creates and updates. Removing it caused `"Rule must have a rank specified"` failures across `url_filtering_rule`, `firewall_rule`, `firewall_dns_rule`, `ssl_inspection_rule`, and `forwarding_rule` (21 failures)
- **`configVersion` injected from target on updates** — `configVersion` is no longer stripped globally. During classification, the target tenant's `configVersion` is stored alongside each queued update and injected into the payload before the API call. Fixes `STALE_CONFIGURATION_ERROR` on `bandwidth_control_rule` (3 failures)
- **Predefined DLP dictionaries no longer attempted as updates** — dictionaries with `predefined: true` were being queued for update when their `accessControl` was `READ_WRITE` and baseline patterns differed. The API refuses pattern edits on predefined dictionaries regardless. These are now treated as read-only and skipped (5 failures: `CUI_LEAKAGE`, `EUIBAN_LEAKAGE`, `NDIU_LEAKAGE`, `RUN_LEAKAGE`, `SSN`)
- **`CIPA Compliance Rule` added to `SKIP_NAMED`** — Zscaler reserves this name; any create or rename attempt returns `INVALID_OPERATION`. The rule is now skipped during classification (1 failure)
- **`_classify_error` false-positive on resource IDs containing "403"** — error classification previously used bare substring matching (`"403" in exc_str`), which matched resource IDs like `/firewallFilteringRules/326403` in SSL/connection error strings. Errors are now classified permanent only when the ZIA JSON payload contains `"status": 400/403/404`. SSL and connection errors are correctly treated as transient and retried (1 failure: `Recommended Firewall Rule`)

---

## [0.10.5] - 2026-03-07

### Added

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline from JSON — push log
- A timestamped log file is written to `~/.local/share/zs-config/logs/zia-push-<timestamp>.log` after every baseline push (Windows: `%APPDATA%\zs-config\logs\`)
- Log includes: tenant name/ID, baseline file path, dry-run classification counts, full push results per resource, and **untruncated** error messages for all failures (the on-screen failure table truncates at 80 characters)
- Resources in `to_delete` that were not executed (user declined or skipped) are listed separately so they remain visible for review

### Fixed
- `pyproject.toml` `license` field changed from deprecated TOML table form (`{text = "MIT"}`) to plain SPDX string (`"MIT"`) — required by setuptools ≥ 77

---

## [0.10.4] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline from JSON (cross-tenant push)
- Replaced narrow `SKIP_IF_PREDEFINED` type gating with universal `_is_zscaler_managed()` detection applied to every resource type. Signals: `predefined:true`, `defaultRule:true`, `type:"PREDEFINED"`, and url_category-specific checks. Zscaler-managed resources now always remap IDs correctly instead of slipping through as false user-defined creates
- Added `defaultRule:true` as a managed-resource signal — catches Zscaler's built-in default firewall, forwarding, and other rule types whose numeric IDs differ across tenants
- Writable managed resources (`accessControl:"READ_WRITE"`) that differ from the baseline are now updated via the existing target-tenant ID rather than attempted as creates (which fail with 400/INVALID_INPUT_ARGUMENT or 409/STALE_CONFIGURATION_ERROR in cross-tenant pushes)
- Read-only managed resources (`accessControl` absent or not `"READ_WRITE"`) are remapped and skipped — no API call issued

### Changed

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline from JSON — delete confirmation
- Deletes are no longer executed automatically as part of the push. After all creates and updates complete, any resources present in the target tenant but absent from the baseline are presented as a separate list requiring explicit confirmation (default: No) before any destructive action is taken
- `push_classified()` no longer executes deletes; new `execute_deletes()` method on `ZIAPushService` handles confirmed deletes, called only from the menu after user approval

---

## [0.10.3] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline from JSON
- `DUPLICATE_ITEM` (400) responses from ZIA now trigger the fallback-to-update path instead of being treated as permanent failures — previously caused false failures for `network_service`, `url_category`, `dlp_engine`, `dlp_dictionary`, and `network_app_group`
- Added `bandwidth_class` to `SKIP_IF_PREDEFINED`; built-in bandwidth classes (`BANDWIDTH_CAT_*`) were being attempted and failing
- Improved predefined detection for `url_category`: fixed `customCategory == False` check (was `is False`, missed SDK-serialized values); added non-numeric ID detection (Zscaler-defined categories have string IDs like `ADULT_SEX_EDUCATION`, custom categories always have numeric IDs)
- Added `type: "PREDEFINED"` detection to `_is_predefined()` — network services and bandwidth classes carry this field instead of a `predefined: true` boolean, causing them to slip through the predefined check
- Added `rank`, `defaultRule`, `accessControl`, `configVersion`, `managedBy` to `READONLY_FIELDS` — server-computed fields returned in GET responses but rejected by POST/PUT; `rank` was the likely cause of "Request body is invalid." on `firewall_dns_rule`, `ssl_inspection_rule`, and `forwarding_rule`
- Config comparison now normalizes list field ordering before comparing — ZIA returns port range arrays in non-deterministic order between API calls, causing false-positive update detections
- `allowlist`/`denylist` no longer queue as updates when the URL list is empty; fixed URL key lookup to handle both snake_case (`whitelist_urls`) and camelCase (`whitelistUrls`) variants

---

## [0.10.2] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

#### ZIA — Activation
- `get_activation_status()` was calling the wrong SDK method (`get_activation_status` → `status()`), causing the Activation menu to immediately show an error and return without activating
- Removed the intermediate `questionary.confirm` in the activation flow — it was silently consuming the buffered Enter keypress from the preceding menu selection, causing activation to be skipped with no feedback
- Removed `console.status()` spinner from the activation call — output printed inside the context manager was being wiped when the spinner exited
- Activation result is now stored and displayed on the next render loop (after the status re-fetch) so it cannot be cleared by `render_banner()`

#### ZIA — Pending activation tracking
- `_zia_pending` session flag per tenant ID — set on every ZIA mutation, cleared on successful activation
- `⚠ Changes pending activation` shown at the top of the ZIA menu and Activation submenu when flag is set
- Main menu ZIA entry shows `⚠` in the label when changes are pending
- Exit and Switch Tenant prompt with a yellow panel and "proceed anyway?" (default: No) when pending changes exist

---

## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-06

### Added

#### ZIA — Source and Destination IPv4 Group CRUD
- **Source IPv4 Group Management** and **Dest IPv4 Group Management** are now full submenus replacing the previous bulk-CSV-only entry
- **List All** — scrollable table showing ID, Name, IP/address count, and Description
- **Search by Name** — partial match filter
- **Create** — prompted fields: name, description, and semicolon-separated addresses; type selector (DSTN_IP / DSTN_FQDN / DSTN_DOMAIN / DSTN_OTHER) for destination groups
- **Edit** — pick from local DB; blank input keeps the current value; updates via API and re-syncs DB
- **Delete** — confirmation prompt (default: No)
- **Bulk Create from CSV** — existing CSV import functionality retained, now nested inside each submenu

---

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

#### ZPA — Access Policy Import / Sync from CSV
- **Export Existing Rules to CSV** — writes all `policy_access` rules to CSV with `id` as the first column; decodes all condition fields (app_groups, applications, saml_attributes, scim_groups, client_types, machine_groups, trusted_networks, platforms, country_codes, idp_names) into readable semicolon-separated values
- **Import / Sync from CSV** (replaces "Bulk Create from CSV") — full Option C mirror sync:
  - Rows with `id` → PUT update (config diff check; skipped if unchanged)
  - Rows without `id` → POST create, captures returned ID
  - Existing rules whose ID is absent from the CSV → DELETE
  - All surviving IDs in CSV row order → `bulk_reorder_rules()` atomic reorder
- **Dry-run preview table** — shows UPDATE / CREATE / DELETE / SKIP / MISSING_DEP / REORDER classification before any API calls; MISSING_DEP rows highlighted in red with dependency issue detail
- **CSV scoping fields** — `machine_groups`, `trusted_networks`, `platforms`, `country_codes`, `idp_names` added to the CSV schema; all are ignore-if-empty; at least one of `app_groups` or `applications` is required per rule
- **Validation** — platform values validated against `{ios, android, mac_os, windows, linux, chrome_os}`; unresolved machine groups, trusted networks, or IdPs are flagged as MISSING_DEP and excluded from sync

#### ZIA — Firewall Rule Export and Import / Sync from CSV
- **Export Firewall Rules to CSV** — writes all `firewall_rule` entries sorted by order; decodes group/service/location references by name from local DB; literal IPs/addresses written as-is
- **Import / Sync Firewall Rules** — same Option C algorithm as ZPA (update / create / delete / reorder); reorder implemented as individual PUTs in descending order (no ZIA bulk-reorder endpoint)
- **MISSING_DEP validation** — rows referencing `src_ip_groups`, `dest_ip_groups`, `nw_services`, `nw_service_groups`, or `locations` not present in the local DB are classified MISSING_DEP and excluded from sync with a hint to create missing groups first
- **Source IPv4 Group Management** — sub-menu (Import from CSV / Export Template / Cancel); CSV columns: `name`, `description`, `ip_addresses`; bulk creates groups via ZIA API with progress bar and per-row error reporting; local DB re-synced on completion
- **Dest IPv4 Group Management** — same pattern; CSV columns: `name`, `type`, `description`, `ip_addresses`; `type` accepts `DSTN_IP`, `DSTN_FQDN`, `DSTN_DOMAIN`, `DSTN_OTHER`

#### ZPA Client (`lib/zpa_client.py`)
- `update_access_rule(rule_id, name, action, **kwargs)` — PUT to `policies.update_rule("access", ...)`
- `bulk_reorder_access_rules(rule_ids)` — calls `policies.bulk_reorder_rules("access", rule_ids)`

#### New / updated service files
- `services/zpa_policy_service.py` — `SyncResult`, `SyncClassification`, `classify_sync()`, `sync_policy()`, `_build_conditions()`, `_decode_conditions()`, `_is_row_unchanged()`; all 10 condition field types supported
- `services/zia_firewall_service.py` (new) — `parse_csv()`, `export_rules_to_csv()`, `resolve_dependencies()`, `classify_sync()`, `sync_rules()`; `parse_ip_source_group_csv()`, `parse_ip_dest_group_csv()`, `bulk_create_ip_source_groups()`, `bulk_create_ip_dest_groups()`

### Fixed

#### ZPA — Access Policy search
- Sort and display key corrected from `ruleOrder` (camelCase) to `rule_order` (snake_case, matching SDK storage)

---

## [0.9.2] - 2026-03-05

### Added

#### Tenant Management — org info auto-fetch
- `TenantConfig`: 4 new columns — `zia_tenant_id` (numeric prefix from `orgInformation.pdomain`), `zia_cloud` (from `cloudName`), `zpa_tenant_cloud` (from `zpaTenantCloud`), `zia_subscriptions` (JSON from `GET /subscriptions`)
- `fetch_org_info()` in `services/config_service.py` — calls `GET /zia/api/v1/orgInformation` and `GET /zia/api/v1/subscriptions`; populates all four columns
- **Add Tenant / Edit Tenant**: ZPA Customer ID prompt removed — `zpa_customer_id` now auto-populated from `orgInformation.zpaTenantId`
- **Switch Tenant**: always refreshes org info on successful auth; shows a summary table on first-time fetch or any field change; yellow subscription-change panel if subscriptions differ between tenants
- **Startup**: `_run_data_migrations()` — runs pending data migrations with Rich progress bar and per-tenant result table; backfills org info for all tenants missing `zia_tenant_id`
- **List Tenants**: table now includes ZIA Cloud, ZIA Tenant ID (numeric), and ZPA Cloud columns
- DB auto-migrations for the four new `TenantConfig` columns added to `db/database.py`

---

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- Banner version string was not updated from 0.8.5 to 0.9.0

---

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

#### ZCC — App Profiles (web policies)
- **App Profiles** added to the `── Configuration ──` section of the ZCC menu
- **List App Profiles** — table shows Name, ID, Platform (Windows / macOS / iOS / Android / Linux), and Active state; data from local DB after Import Config
- **Search by Name** — partial name match
- **View Details** — full JSON scroll view of the stored policy record
- **Manage Custom Bypass Apps** — select a profile to view its currently assigned bypass app services; add or remove services via checkbox multi-select; change is applied immediately via `web/policy/edit` API and the local DB is refreshed
- **Activate / Deactivate** — checkbox multi-select across profiles; choose target platform; activates or deactivates each selected profile via `web/policy/activate`
- **Delete** — select profile, confirm (default No), delete via API, and re-import to refresh DB

#### ZCC — Bypass App Definitions (web app services)
- **Bypass App Definitions** added to the `── Configuration ──` section of the ZCC menu (renamed from "Custom App Bypasses" to clarify this is a library of available definitions, not what is actively bypassed per profile)
- **List All** — table shows Name, Type (Zscaler vs Custom), Svc ID, Active, Version; Type is determined by `createdBy` — numeric values indicate Zscaler-managed definitions
- **Search by Name** — partial name match
- **View Details** — full JSON scroll view

#### ZCC Import — new resource types
- `web_app_service` — bypass app service definitions synced via `webAppService/listByCompany`
- `web_policy` — app profiles synced per platform (Windows / macOS / iOS / Android / Linux) and deduplicated; stored in camelCase (API-native) format for round-trip edit compatibility

#### ZCC Client (`lib/zcc_client.py`)
- `_to_camel_dict()` — recursive helper that converts SDK `ZscalerObject` instances to camelCase plain dicts using `request_format()`; avoids the `ZscalerCollection.form_list` in-place mutation bug that causes `resp.get_body()` to contain non-JSON-serialisable SDK model objects
- `list_web_app_services()` — lists bypass app service definitions
- `list_web_policies()` — fetches policies for all 5 platforms, deduplicates by ID, injects `device_type` for display
- `edit_web_policy(**kwargs)` — PUT to `web/policy/edit`
- `activate_web_policy(policy_id, device_type)` — PUT to `web/policy/activate`
- `delete_web_policy(policy_id)` — DELETE to `web/policy/{id}/delete`

#### ZCC Service (`services/zcc_service.py`)
- Audit-logged wrappers for all five new client methods above

### Fixed

#### ZCC menu — "← Back" crash in selection prompts
- `questionary.select` with `value=None` returns the title string in some versions rather than `None`; replaced `if not selected` guards with `if not isinstance(selected, dict)` in all affected detail/delete/manage prompts

---

## [0.8.5] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

#### Update checker — changelog prompt UX
- Added a `Press any key to view changelog...` pause between the update panel and the scroll viewer so the notification is readable before the alternate screen opens

---

## [0.8.4] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

#### Update checker — NameError crash on startup
- `Markdown` was accidentally dropped from imports when refactoring to `scroll_view`; moved to a local import inside the branch that uses it
- Fixes `NameError: name 'Markdown' is not defined` crash whenever an update was available

---

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

#### Update checker — changelog scroll UX
- Changelog now opens in the full-screen scroll viewer (↑↓ / j k / PgDn / PgUp / g / G / q) instead of printing inline
- Fixes the update panel being pushed off screen by long changelogs; the panel reappears after exiting the viewer since scroll_view uses the alternate screen buffer

---

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-04

### Added

#### Auto-update checker
- On startup (after the banner), zs-config silently checks PyPI for a newer version
- If an update is available, a yellow panel shows the version delta (`v0.8.1 → v0.8.2`)
- Relevant CHANGELOG sections are fetched from GitHub and rendered inline so you can review what changed before upgrading
- A `questionary.confirm` prompt (default: Yes) offers to upgrade immediately using the detected install method (`pipx upgrade zs-config` or `pip install --upgrade zs-config`)
- If confirmed, the upgrade runs live in the terminal; on success a green panel is shown and the process exits so you re-launch the updated binary
- If declined or if the upgrade fails, the tool continues normally; a red panel with the manual upgrade command is shown on failure
- All network requests use a 4-second timeout — startup is unaffected on slow or offline networks
- New file: `cli/update_checker.py`

---

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-02

### Added

#### Credential verification on tenant add and switch
- `ZscalerAuth.get_token()` — direct OAuth2 `client_credentials` POST to
  `{zidentity_base_url}/oauth2/v1/token`; raises on failure (also fixes a latent
  bug where `conf_writer.test_credentials` called this method before it existed)
- **Add Tenant**: immediately tests credentials after saving; shows ✓ on success
  or ✗ with a pointer to Settings → Edit Tenant on failure (tenant is saved either way)
- **Switch Tenant**: verifies token with a spinner before activating the session;
  on failure offers three options — Edit credentials / Switch anyway / Cancel
- **Settings → Edit Tenant** (new): pick a tenant, edit vanity subdomain, client ID,
  and/or client secret (blank = keep existing); live token test before saving;
  "Save anyway?" offered if test fails

---

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline: skip `ZSCALER_PROXY_NW_SERVICES`
- Added `SKIP_NAMED` constant — a per-type dict of resource names that are system-managed
  but lack a `predefined:true` flag in their API response (e.g. `ZSCALER_PROXY_NW_SERVICES`
  returns a 403 `EDIT_INTERNAL_DATA_NOT_ALLOWED` on any write attempt)
- `_is_predefined()` now checks `SKIP_NAMED` in addition to the `predefined` boolean and
  the `url_category` type-field heuristics; these resources are silently skipped during
  classification and never queued for push

### Changed

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline: dry-run comparison before push
- `classify_baseline()` is now a standalone phase: runs a full import of the target tenant
  and classifies each baseline entry as **create / update / skip** — no API writes
- `push_classified()` accepts the `DryRunResult` returned by `classify_baseline()` and
  executes the actual multi-pass push
- `apply_baseline_menu()` now shows a **Comparison Result** table after classification
  (type | Create | Update | Skip) plus a per-resource list of pending creates and updates
  (capped at 30 each), then asks for confirmation before issuing any API calls
- If the target is already in sync (0 creates, 0 updates), the user is informed and the
  menu returns without making any API calls

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline: delta-only push strategy
- Before pushing anything, a full ZIA import is now run against the target tenant
  to capture its current state
- Each baseline entry is compared (after stripping read-only fields such as
  `id`, `lastModifiedTime`, etc.) to the freshly imported record:
  - **Identical** → skipped; no API call made
  - **Changed** → updated directly using the known target ID
  - **Not found** → created
- Eliminates redundant pushes of unchanged resources (e.g. all 110 predefined
  URL categories that exist in every tenant were previously pushed and 409'd on
  every run)
- `SKIP_IF_PREDEFINED` covers `url_category`, `dlp_engine`, `dlp_dictionary`,
  `network_service` — predefined resources in these types are always skipped
  regardless of content; Zscaler manages their lifecycle independently
- Push classification is now done upfront; `_push_one` no longer uses speculative
  create → 409 → name-lookup for known resources (409 fallback kept as safety net
  for edge cases where the import snapshot is stale)
- Menu prompt updated: "Import target state + push deltas" — shows import progress
  (`Syncing: <type> N/M`) followed by push progress (`[Pass N] <type> — <name>`)
  in a single combined status display

### Added

#### ZIA — Import Gaps Filled (27 → 35 resource types)
- `dlp_web_rule` — DLP Web Rules via `zia.dlp_web_rules.list_rules()`
- `nat_control_rule` — NAT Control Policy via `zia.nat_control_policy.list_rules()`
- `bandwidth_class` — Bandwidth Classes via `zia.bandwidth_classes.list_classes()`
- `bandwidth_control_rule` — Bandwidth Control Rules via `zia.bandwidth_control_rules.list_rules()`
- `traffic_capture_rule` — Traffic Capture Rules via `zia.traffic_capture.list_rules()`
- `workload_group` — Workload Groups via `zia.workload_groups.list_groups()`
- `network_app` — Network Apps (read-only) via `zia.cloud_firewall.list_network_apps()`
- `network_app_group` — Network App Groups via `zia.cloud_firewall.list_network_app_groups()`

#### ZIA — DLP Web Rules submenu
- New **DLP Web Rules** entry under the `── DLP ──` section
- Submenu: List All (ordered by policy order), Search by Name, View Details (JSON scroll view)

#### ZIA — Apply Baseline from JSON (Push)
- New `── Baseline ──` section in the ZIA menu with **Apply Baseline from JSON**
- Reads a ZIA snapshot export JSON (must have `product: "ZIA"` and `resources` key)
- Shows a summary table (resource type | count) before pushing
- Runs ordered passes with retry until the error set stabilises
- On HTTP 409: looks up existing resource by name in the target env and updates it
- ID remapping: as objects are created/located, a `source_id → target_id` table is
  built and applied to all subsequent payloads, handling cross-environment references
- Push order: rule_label → time_interval → workload_group → bandwidth_class → URL/firewall
  objects → locations → all rule types → allowlist/denylist
- Skips env-specific types: `user`, `group`, `department`, `admin_user`, `admin_role`,
  `location_group`, `network_app`, `cloud_app_policy`, `cloud_app_ssl_policy`
- Skips predefined/system resources within `dlp_engine`, `dlp_dictionary`,
  `url_category`, `network_service`
- Allowlist/denylist: merge only (add entries, never replace existing list)
- Final results table: type | created | updated | skipped | failed
- Failure detail list for any resources that could not be pushed
- Prompts to activate ZIA changes if anything was created or updated

#### ZIA Client — write methods (~40 new)
New `create_*` / `update_*` / `delete_*` methods for: `rule_label`, `time_interval`,
`location`, `url_filtering_rule`, `firewall_rule`, `firewall_dns_rule`, `firewall_ips_rule`,
`ssl_inspection_rule`, `forwarding_rule`, `ip_destination_group`, `ip_source_group`,
`network_service`, `network_svc_group`, `network_app_group`, `dlp_web_rule`,
`nat_control_rule`, `bandwidth_class`, `bandwidth_control_rule`, `traffic_capture_rule`,
`workload_group`

#### New file: `services/zia_push_service.py`
- `ZIAPushService` — push engine with multi-pass retry, ID remapping, and per-record reporting
- `PushRecord` dataclass — tracks per-resource outcome (created / updated / skipped / failed)
- `PUSH_ORDER`, `SKIP_TYPES`, `SKIP_IF_PREDEFINED`, `READONLY_FIELDS` constants

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

#### ZIA — Cloud Applications (read-only catalog)
- New `── Cloud Apps ──` section in the ZIA menu
- **Cloud Applications** — list all apps associated with DLP/CAC policy rules or SSL policy rules; search by name across either policy set; data populated via Import Config
- Table shows: app name, parent category, ID

#### ZIA — Cloud App Control (full CRUD)
- **Cloud App Control** — browse rules by rule type; type list derived from DB after import
- Per-type submenu: list rules, view details (JSON scroll view), create from JSON file, edit from JSON file, duplicate rule (prompts for new name), delete rule (with confirmation)
- All mutations audit-logged, re-sync DB automatically, and remind user to activate changes in ZIA
- Rules stored in DB via Import Config; list sorted by order/rank

#### ZIA Import (`services/zia_import_service.py`)
- Added `cloud_app_policy`, `cloud_app_ssl_policy`, and `cloud_app_control_rule` to `RESOURCE_DEFINITIONS` (import count: 24 → 27)
- `list_all_cloud_app_rules()` iterates 18 known rule types (hardcoded — SDK's `form_response_body` mangles `UPPER_SNAKE` keys via `pydash.camel_case`, making `get_rule_type_mapping()` unusable as a driver)

#### ZIA Client (`lib/zia_client.py`)
- `list_cloud_app_policy`, `list_cloud_app_ssl_policy`
- `list_all_cloud_app_rules`, `get_cloud_app_rule_types`, `list_cloud_app_rules`, `get_cloud_app_rule`
- `create_cloud_app_rule`, `update_cloud_app_rule`, `delete_cloud_app_rule`, `duplicate_cloud_app_rule`

### Fixed
- **ZCC Entitlements**: base URL corrected to `/zcc/papi/public/v1` (was `/mobileadmin/v1`); GET methods use direct HTTP against the correct endpoint
- **ZIA URL Lookup**: missing `press_any_key_to_continue` on error/empty paths caused errors to be wiped by `render_banner()` before user could read them; empty result set now handled gracefully
- **ZIA URL Lookup**: SDK method name corrected to `lookup` (was `url_lookup`); return value correctly unpacked as 2-tuple `(result, error)`

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **ZIA — DLP Engines / Dictionaries list**: rows were sorted alphabetically by name; now sorted numerically by ZIA ID
- **ZCC Entitlements / ZDX — 401 Unauthorized**: direct-HTTP token requests (`_get_token`) were missing the `audience: https://api.zscaler.com` body parameter required by the Zscaler OneAPI token endpoint; the Postman collection's collection-level OAuth2 config reveals this as mandatory. Added to `lib/zcc_client.py` and `lib/zdx_client.py`.

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

#### ZIA — DLP CRUD
- **DLP Engines** — list, search, view details (JSON scroll view), create from JSON file, edit from JSON file, delete; all mutations remind the user to activate changes in ZIA
- **DLP Dictionaries** — same CRUD operations plus CSV-based creation and editing; CSV format: one value per row (header optional); phrases and patterns are supported separately
- Both DLP submenus are accessible under a new `── DLP ──` section in the ZIA menu, inserted after `── Identity & Access ──`
- DB is re-synced automatically after every create/update/delete via a targeted `ZIAImportService.run(resource_types=[...])` call

#### ZIA Client (`lib/zia_client.py`)
- `get_dlp_engine`, `create_dlp_engine`, `update_dlp_engine`, `delete_dlp_engine`
- `get_dlp_dictionary`, `create_dlp_dictionary`, `update_dlp_dictionary`, `delete_dlp_dictionary`

#### ZCC — Entitlements
- **Entitlements** added to the `── Configuration ──` section of the ZCC menu
- **View ZPA / ZDX Entitlements** — fetches live data and renders a group access table (or raw JSON if structure is non-standard)
- **Manage ZPA / ZDX Group Access** — checkbox multi-select to toggle group access; confirms changes before PUT; audit-logged

#### ZCC Client (`lib/zcc_client.py`)
- OAuth2 direct-HTTP token management (same 30 s early-refresh pattern as `zidentity_client.py`)
- `get_zpa_entitlements`, `get_zdx_entitlements` — GET from `mobileadmin/v1/getZpaGroupEntitlements` and `getZdxGroupEntitlements`
- `update_zpa_entitlements`, `update_zdx_entitlements` — PUT to corresponding update endpoints

#### ZDX — Help Desk Module (new product area)
- **Main menu** — `ZDX  Zscaler Digital Experience` added between ZCC and ZIdentity
- **Time window picker** — 2 / 4 / 8 / 24 hours, shown at menu entry or per-action as needed
- **Device Lookup & Health** — hostname/email search → device picker → health metrics table + events table in a single scroll view
- **App Performance on Device** — search device → list apps with ZDX scores → optional drill into a single app for detailed JSON metrics
- **User Lookup** — email/name search → users table with device count and ZDX score
- **Application Scores** — all apps with color-coded ZDX scores (green ≥80, yellow ≥50, red <50) and affected user count
- **Deep Trace** — list traces per device; start new trace (device picker → optional app scope → session name → POST → status poll); view trace results (JSON); stop trace (DELETE)
- All READ operations audit-logged with `product="ZDX"`; CREATE/DELETE mutations audit-logged with resource details

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

#### ZPA — Menu Expansion
- **App Segment Groups** — list and search from local DB cache (group name, enabled state, config space, application count)
- **PRA Consoles** — list, search, enable/disable, and delete; follows same pattern as PRA Portals
- **Service Edges** — new top-level ZPA submenu; list and search (name, group, channel status, private IP, version, enabled), enable/disable via API with immediate DB update
- **Access Policy** — replaces [coming soon] stub; list and search policy_access rules from DB cache (name, action type, description)

#### ZIA — Menu Expansion
- **Security Policy Settings** — view, add to, and remove URLs from the allowlist and denylist
- **URL Categories** — list all categories with ID, type, and URL count; search by name; add/remove custom URLs per category
- **URL Filtering** — list and search rules (order, name, action, state); enable/disable checkbox multi-select
- **Traffic Forwarding** — list and search forwarding rules (read-only DB view: name, type, description)
- **Users** — list and search from DB cache (username, email, department, group count)

#### ZCC — Menu Expansion
- **Import Config** — sync ZCC device inventory, trusted networks, forwarding profiles, and admin users into local DB
- **Reset N/A Resource Types** — clear auto-disabled ZCC resource types so they are retried on the next import
- **Trusted Networks** — list and search from DB cache (name, network ID)
- **Forwarding Profiles** — list and search from DB cache (name, profile type)
- **Admin Users** — list and search from DB cache (username, role, email)

#### Config Import Expansion (Priorities 1–2)

**ZPA** — 7 new resource types added to the import service:
`pra_console`, `service_edge_group`, `service_edge`, `server`, `machine_group`, `trusted_network`, `lss_config`

**ZIA** — 5 new resource types:
`user`, `dlp_engine`, `dlp_dictionary`, `allowlist` (singleton), `denylist` (singleton)

**ZCC** — full new import service (`services/zcc_import_service.py`):
`device`, `trusted_network`, `forwarding_profile`, `admin_user`
Auto-disables resource types on 401 or 403; `ZCCResource` DB model mirrors ZPA/ZIA pattern.

#### ZIA Client (`lib/zia_client.py`)
- `list_dlp_engines`, `list_dlp_dictionaries`
- `list_allowlist`, `list_denylist` (singleton wrappers for the import service)
- `add_to_allowlist`, `remove_from_allowlist`, `add_to_denylist`, `remove_from_denylist`
- `get_url_filtering_rule`, `update_url_filtering_rule`
- `add_urls_to_category`, `remove_urls_from_category`

#### ZPA Client (`lib/zpa_client.py`)
- `get_policy_rule`, `update_policy_rule`
- PRA Console CRUD: `list_pra_consoles`, `get_pra_console`, `create_pra_console`, `update_pra_console`, `delete_pra_console`
- `list_service_edge_groups`, `list_service_edges`, `get_service_edge`, `update_service_edge`
- `list_servers`, `list_machine_groups`, `list_trusted_networks`, `list_lss_configs`

#### ZCC Client (`lib/zcc_client.py`)
- `list_trusted_networks`, `list_forwarding_profiles`, `list_admin_users`

#### Database
- `ZCCResource` model (`db/models.py`) with `zcc_id` unique key and standard `raw_config` / `config_hash` / `is_deleted` columns
- `zcc_disabled_resources` JSON column on `TenantConfig`
- SQLite migration applied automatically on next launch

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **ZCC — List Devices**: removed `page` query parameter from default request; the ZCC API rejected it with a 400, likely treating it as invalid for this endpoint. `pageSize` alone is sufficient.
- **ZIdentity — List Users / Groups / API Clients**: the ZIdentity SDK returns model wrapper objects (`Users`, `Groups`, `APIClients`) rather than plain lists. The shared `_to_dicts` helper tried to call `vars()` on these objects, causing `attribute name must be string, not 'int'`. Replaced with a dedicated `_zid_list` extractor that unpacks the wrapper via `as_dict()` and pulls the first list-valued field.

### Changed

#### CLI / UX
- Main menu: "Switch Tenant" renamed to "Tenant Management"; now opens the full tenant management submenu (add / list / remove / switch)
- "Switch Tenant" moved into the Tenant Management submenu as the first option
- Settings menu: removed "Generate Encryption Key" and "Configure Server Credentials File" options (no longer needed)

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-25

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

#### ZIA — Import Config
- Pulls 19 resource types from the ZIA API into a new `ZIAResource` local DB table
- SHA-256 change detection — re-runs only write rows whose content has changed
- Automatic N/A detection — resource types that return 401 or `NOT_SUBSCRIBED` (403) are skipped and recorded per tenant
- **Reset N/A Resource Types** — clear the auto-disabled list so they are retried on the next import

#### ZIA — Firewall Policy
- **List / Search Firewall Rules** — scrollable table: Order, Name, Action, State (green ENABLED / red DISABLED), Description
- **Enable / Disable Firewall Rules** — checkbox multi-select; patches `state` via API and updates local DB immediately
- **List / Search DNS Filter Rules** — same table layout as firewall rules
- **Enable / Disable DNS Rules** — checkbox multi-select
- **List / Search IPS Rules** — shows subscription-not-available message when `firewall_ips_rule` is marked N/A for the tenant

#### ZIA — Locations
- **List Locations** — scrollable table: Name, Country, Timezone, Sub-location flag, VPN flag
- **Search Locations** — partial name match
- **List Location Groups** — table: Name, Type, Location count

#### ZIA — SSL Inspection
- **List Rules** — scrollable table: Order, Name, Action (extracts `type` from nested action object), State, Description
- **Search Rules** — partial name match
- **Enable / Disable** — checkbox multi-select; patches `state` via API and updates local DB immediately

#### ZPA — Menu restructure
- **Privileged Remote Access** replaces the old "PRA Portals" top-level item — new parent submenu containing PRA Portals (active) and PRA Consoles (coming soon)
- **Access Policy** coming-soon stub added to ZPA menu
- **App Segment Groups** coming-soon stub added to the App Segments submenu

### Changed
- Main menu: ZIA moved above ZPA
- ZIA menu order: SSL Inspection → Locations → Firewall Policy → URL Lookup *(active section)* · coming-soon stubs *(middle section)* · Activation → Import Config → Reset N/A → Back *(bottom section)*

### Fixed
- SSL Inspection list/search crash — `action` field in SSL rules is a nested object; now extracts `action["type"]` for display
- ZIA Import: `url_categories` SDK method corrected (`list_categories` not `list_url_categories`); `url_filtering` corrected (`list_rules` not `list_url_filtering_rules`)
- ZIA Import: `NOT_SUBSCRIBED` (403) errors now treated identically to 401 — resource type is auto-disabled and skipped on future runs
- Admin & Roles removed from ZIA menu — the ZIA admin users endpoint returns an empty list for tenants using ZIdentity; will be revisited under the ZIdentity product area

---

## [0.0.2] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- Windows compatibility — all `chmod` / `os.chmod` calls are now guarded with `sys.platform != "win32"` so the tool runs on Windows without raising `NotImplementedError`
